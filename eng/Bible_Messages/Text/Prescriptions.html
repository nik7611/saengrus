<FONT FACE="Georgia"><FONT SIZE=3>I want to tell you this morning that I am a Christian by conversion and a Salvationist by conviction. I am a Christian because years ago I made a commitment to Jesus Christ and I am a Salvationist because God used the Army to bring me to Himself. I am a Christian because God in Christ forgave my sins and I am a Salvationist because the people at the Army accepted me as I was and did not pass judgement on my life. I am a Christian because the Holy Spirit entered my life and I became a new person on the day I knelt and accepted Christ as my personal Saviour and I am a Salvationist because God used the Army the help me maintain and grow in that new life experience. I am a Christian because today the blood of Jesus Christ is applied to my life and I am a Salvationist because that is where God wants me today.</FONT></FONT><P LANG="en-US" ALIGN=CENTER>

There is no pill that going to stop you from worrying! There&rsquo;s
no seminar or book or tape that going to do it for you! There&rsquo;s
not even a spiritual experience that&rsquo;s going to cure you from
worry! God&rsquo;s prescription for worry comes down to you and I
making a daily choice, a constant choice, in which we say, &ldquo;Am
I going to believe the Lord is my Shepherd and let Him be in control
or am I going to try and take charge of my own life and try to handle
everything on my own?&rdquo; Who&rsquo;s going to control your life?
Who&rsquo;s going to call the shots! If I&rsquo;m going to be in
control then I have lots to worry about but if God is in control then
it&rsquo;s His problem and He is more than capable of handling
anything that comes my way!</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=2><SPAN LANG="en-US">Let
make a little suggestion to you! When you have your devotions spend
the whole week meditating and thinking about Psalm 23. You are going
to find that seventeen times in six verses the personal words, &ldquo;I&rdquo;,
&ldquo;my&rdquo; or &ldquo;me&rdquo; are used and the word &ldquo;You&rdquo;
referring to God is used five times. That makes Psalm 23 an intensely
personal psalm. It&rsquo;s about our relationship with God and that&rsquo;s
God&rsquo;s prescription and antidote for stress. Getting religious
will not stop you worrying. In fact, it may even make it worse. You
don&rsquo;t need religion. What you need is a relationship with God</SPAN></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=2><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>.

Chapman was asked to visit and try to cheer up a little 10 year old
boy who was dying of cancer. He went to the home of the boy and the
little boy was worrying about dying. Chapman said, &ldquo;I want to
teach you something. Let me have your hand. The Bible says, &lsquo;The
Lord is my Shepherd.&rsquo; Every time you start to get worried about
what&rsquo;s going to happen to you just think, &lsquo;The Lord is my

later the boy died and his mother found him holding on to his index
finger.</FONT></FONT></P>
