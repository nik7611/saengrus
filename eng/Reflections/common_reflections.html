When things in your life seem almost too much to handle, when 24 hours in a day are not enough, remember the mayonnaise and the 2 cups of coffee.
<br><br>
If you take a large empty mayonnaise jar and fill it with golf balls, then when no more balls fit, you could say that the jar is full.  Not so!
<br><br>
Just pick up some pebbles and pour them into the jar.  Shake the jar lightly.  The pebbles will roll into the open areas between the golf balls.  Now you can say the jar is full—right? Wrong!
<br><br>
If you take some sand and pour it into the jar, you would have to agree that this time the jar is full.  But wait a minute...you can take two cups of coffee and pour them completely into the jar effectively filling the empty space between the sand.
<br><br>
What’s my point?
<br><br>
The jar represents your life.  The golf balls are the important things: God, your family, your children, your health, your friends and your favourite passions.  If everything else was lost, or taken away, and only they remained, your life would still be full.
<br><br>
The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house and your car, bank account, investments, RRSP’s, vacations…
<br><br>
The sand is everything else—the small stuff.  The boat, the bike, the cottage, the sports car, designer clothes, diamond rings, plasma TV’s...get the picture?
<br><br>
Now, if you put sand into the jar first, there would be no room for the pebbles or the golf balls.  The same goes for life.
<br><br>
If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you.  Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Play with your children.  Take your spouse out to dinner.  Get regular medical checkups.  Play another round of golf.  There will always be time to clean the house and put out the garbage.
<br><br>
Take care of the golf balls first– the things that really matter.  Set your priorities.  The rest is just sand.
<br><br>
What about the coffee?  I’m glad you asked!  It just goes to show  you that no matter how full your life may seem, there’s always room for coffee with a friend.
