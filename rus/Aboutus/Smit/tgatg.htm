</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The Book
of Romans begins, Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ (1:1a). The word
"servant" in Greek is doulos, which means "bondslave." A bondslave had
no rights of his own. He belonged totally to his master. As a bondslave
of Jesus Christ, Paul was living totally for his Master.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul was
called to be an apostle (1:1b). "Apostle" literally means "one who is
sent." In his calling Paul was separated unto the gospel of God (1:1c).
We remember that in the Book of Acts the Holy Spirit said, "Separate me
Barnabas and Saul [Paul] for the work whereunto I have called them. And
when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they
sent them away" (Acts 13:2-3). Paul was sent by the Holy Spirit to bear
the Gospel to the Gentiles. The word "gospel" means "good news." To
hear some people tell it, God is bad news. But that's not true! God's
love for us in Jesus Christ is good news.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">(Which he
had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures) (1:2). This
Gospel wasn't an event that simply happened without warning. The
message of the Gospel, especially to the Gentiles, was spoken of by God
through the prophets. (When Paul refers to the "holy scriptures," he
has only the Old Testament in mind.)
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The good
news is about God's Son, Jesus Christ our Lord (1:3a). So often we read
the "Lord Jesus Christ" and think of this as His first, middle, and
last name. "Lord" is not His name; it is His title. The Greek word for
"lord" is kurios.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">"Jesus"
is His name. This is a Greek translation of the Hebrew name "Joshua,"
meaning "Jehovah is salvation." In Matthew's gospel we read, "The angel
of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of
David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is
conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And she shall bring forth a son,
and thou shalt call his name Jesus: for he shall save his people from
their sins" (Matthew 1:20-21). His name implies His mission: "he shall
save his people from their sins." "Christ" is Greek for the Hebrew word
meaning "messiah" or "the anointed one of God," the one whom God had
promised to send to His people. "Christ" or "Messiah" signifies His
ministry as the fulfillment of the promise of God. "Jesus Christ our
Lord" signifies the believer's relationship to Him.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">In the
Bible we read, "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus,
and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the
dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto
righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation"
(Romans 10:9-10). The first part of that passage would be better
translated, "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth that Jesus Christ is
Lord." Our obligation is more than confessing belief in Jesus Christ.
You can believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, but not be saved.
You can believe that He died on the cross for your sins, yet not be
born again. It's necessary to submit your life to Him as Lord of your
life in order to have salvation.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Concerning
his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David
according to the flesh (1:3). As king of Israel, David had a beautiful
house in Jerusalem. When he saw the tent where people were worshipping
God, he said, "Here I am dwelling in this exquisite palace, and all we
have is a tent for God. I'm going to build a beautiful house for Him."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The
prophet Nathan told him, "David, that sounds like a marvelous idea."
But that night the Lord spoke to Nathan and told him that he had spoken
hastily. "Go back and tell David that he can't build My house. It's
good that the desire is in his heart, but he has shed too much blood."
To soften David's disappointment God told Nathan, "Tell David that I'm
going to build him a house."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">So, the
prophet told David, "I have some good news and some bad news. The bad
news is that you can't build a house for God. The good news is that God
is going to build you a house." God was telling David that through him
the Messiah would come. God would establish His kingdom through David's
seed, and there would never lack one from his offspring to sit upon the
throne.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">David was
overwhelmed. "Who am I, O Lord God, and what is mine house, that thou
hast brought me hitherto?" (I Chronicles 17:1-16). The Lord took David
from following after sheep and made him ruler over His people. Now He
planned to build David a house and establish his throne forever.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">"Lord,
what can I say?" David was speechless. Now that's a remarkable
statement for David to make, because he was very gifted with words.
Whenever I find it difficult to express my feelings to God, I turn to
the Psalms where David expresses such things so well. Yet, here David
was speechless because of God's goodness and grace. It's a wonderful
experience when God so blesses us that words become inadequate to
describe our feelings. As Savonarola said, "When prayer reaches its
ultimate, words are impossible."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">As we
trace the genealogy of Christ back through Mary in Luke's gospel, we
find Him coming through the line of David. Jesus is God incarnate and
the seed of David, the beautiful God-Man, declared to be the Son of God
with power, according to the spirit of holiness (1:4), for He was
conceived by the Holy Spirit.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Some
people say that the Virgin Birth is only mentioned in two of the
Gospels and so we don't need to accept the event as fact. If we don't
accept the Virgin Birth as fact, then who was Jesus' father? How many
times does God have to tell us something before we believe it? God has
told us twice. Isn't that enough? Jesus is the seed of David according
to the flesh; and declared to be the Son of God with power, according
to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead (1:3b-4).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">By whom
we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith
among all nations, for his name (1:5). Paul had the anointing and
calling of an apostle, although he considered himself to be the chief
of sinners (I Timothy 1:12-15).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Among
whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ. And now a salutation, To
all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you
and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ (1:6-7). The
first title given to the believers, "beloved of God," fits everyone.
Many times it's difficult for us to accept God's love, because we
oftentimes don't really love ourselves. Since we don't love ourselves,
we wonder how can God love us. But He does!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">More than
that, we're called "saints." It was tragic when the Church decided to
honor certain people for special deeds, thus setting criteria for
sainthood. Should miracles occur by praying to a deceased person who
was known for doing outstanding works during his lifetime, then the
Church chose to consider the person a saint. Don't worry if the Church
overlooked you. God has chosen you, and it's better to be considered a
saint by God than from the Church any day. You have been called a
saint. Now live up to your calling.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Grace to
you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ (1:7b).
Grace and peace are called the Siamese twins of the New Testament
because they're always coupled together. This is the proper order of
the two words, for you can't have the peace of God until you've first
experienced His grace.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Peace
with God is necessary before you can have the peace of God. They're two
different experiences. You can experience peace with God when you're
saved, but still not know the peace of God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Many
Christians are upset, worried, and frantic. They're not sure that God
will work out everything, and their lives are in turmoil. They don't
have the peace of God. This is the peace to which Paul is referring.
After I recognize that the grace of God is unmerited favor, I can
experience the peace of God because I'm no longer striving. I realize
that His blessings haven't been earned by my merit or goodness. I'm now
trusting in God's completed work, and I'm at peace in my relationship
with God. I've totally committed myself to Him.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">First,
said Paul, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all (1:8a). In
the New Testament we're taught to pray to God through Jesus Christ.
"Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name," Jesus said, "that will I do, that
the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you shall ask any thing in
my name, I will do it" (John 14:13-14).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Your
faith is spoken of throughout the whole world (1:8b). The godly faith
of the Roman believers was well-known throughout the Church world.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For God
is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son,
that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers (1:9).
Paul's prayers were in the closet, so to speak. Paul states, "God is my
witness," because he can't call on any man to verify his prayers. He
was following the instructions Jesus gave us when He said, "Enter into
thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which
is in secret" (Matthew 6:6a).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Making
request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous
journey by the will of God to come unto you. For I long to see you,
that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be
established (1:10-11). Paul's motive for going to Rome wasn't to see
the great Forum or the Circus Maximus, but to minister to the
believers. He wanted to impart some spiritual gift through which they
might be strengthened.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">That is,
that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of
you and me (1:12). Gathering together with God's people has a two-way
effect. You cannot minister to others without being ministered to
yourself. That's the beauty of sharing our spiritual gifts with one
another. Jesus said, "Give, and it shall be given unto you" (Luke
6:38a). Sowing the truth in love always reaps the same.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Now I
would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to
come unto you, (but was let hitherto) that I might have some fruit
among you also, even as among other Gentiles (1:13). Paul wanted to
visit them before, but had been hindered. The apostle wasn't
deliberately slighting the Romans by his absence.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">I am
debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and
to the unwise (1:14). "Barbarian" is an unfortunate word here because
of its modern meaning as "savage." The term originated because the
Greeks considered that all foreign languages sounded like "bar-bar" on
incomprehensible babbling. The expression actually referred to those
who didn't speak Greek. It wasn't a derogatory expression in Paul's
day.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">So, as
much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at
Rome also. For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the
power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew
first, and also to the Greek (1:15-16). Jesus Christ is God's power of
salvation. To whom? To everyone who believes.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For
therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it
is written, The just shall live by faith (1:17). Paul begins early in
the book to introduce the two themes of his message: (1) the
righteousness which is of God through faith and (2) the just shall live
by faith. Man's righteousness before God isn't predicated upon the Law
of Moses or the works of man, but upon believing in the work of God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For the
wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and
unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness (1:18).
Verse 16 emphasizes the power of God, verse 17 the righteousness of
God, and verse 18 the wrath of God. People talk about the power and
righteousness of God, but they often deny or ignore one aspect of God's
nature - His wrath.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The
Mosaic Law was written on two tablets of stone. The first tablet dealt
with man's relationship with God; the second dealt with man's
relationship with his fellow man. A man is ungodly when he isn't right
with God; he is unrighteous when he isn't right with his fellow man as
God wishes him to be.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The wrath
of God is to be revealed against the ungodliness and unrighteousness of
men. The two tablets of stone are thus tied together. You cannot have a
right relationship with God and a wrong relationship with your brother.
If you say that you love God, then you have to love your brother also.
You cannot love God and hate your brother.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Some
people hold the truth of God, but they hold it in unrighteousness. You
say you believe in God. That's wonderful. It's the place to start, but
alone it isn't enough. The devils believe in God, so what makes you
different from them? You must believe in God and glorify Him. That's
the difference!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Because
that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed
it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the
world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made,
even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse
(1:19-20). The existence of God is universally attested to. The design
of His work is self-evident to all. Those who deny or ignore God are
totally without excuse.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">When they
knew God, they glorified him not as God (1:21a). Paul's first
indictment against natural men is that they knew God, but they didn't
glorify Him as God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">How many
times have I failed to honor God and instead found myself arguing with
Him. Peter and Paul argued with the Lord. This trait is part of my
human weakness, and it doesn't give glory to God. By arguing with God,
I bring Him down to my level, and even reduce Him below my level,
because my premise is that I'm right. It's ridiculous! God knows far
more about my own situation than I do.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Neither
were [they] thankful (1:21b). First Thessalonians 5:18 says, "In
everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus
concerning you." The circumstances of your life have been ordained by
God and are working together according to a divine plan. "The steps of
a good man are ordered by the Lord" (Psalm 37:23a). Nothing happens to
you by happenstance or accident. Don't say, "Good luck!" There is no
such thing for a Christian. Similarly whenever you complain about your
circumstances you're actually complaining about God. He has brought
certain situations into your life for the best. When you moan and
groan, God is displeased with your unthankful heart.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">As
Christians we need to learn to accept the things that come across our
paths. "We know that all things work together for good to them that
love God" (Romans 8:28a). May this truth be embedded in our hearts!
When events that seem like tremendous tragedies come, we often ask, "If
God loves me how could He allow this to happen?" We can't understand
everything that comes across our paths, and God doesn't promise us
total understanding. The lyrics to an old southern song have brought
comfort to many.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Further along we'll know all about it.
<br>Further along we'll understand why.
<br>Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine.
<br>We'll understand it all by and by.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The point
of the song is that in heaven we can sit down with Jesus and ask, "Why
did that have to happen?" However, when we get to heaven, we'll be so
excited and full of rejoicing that we'll just enjoy it all! God doesn't
owe us any explanations, but we owe Him our complete obedience,
surrender, and submission.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Imagine
the potter with the clay. In front of him is the potter's wheel used to
shape the vessel. After getting the clay to the right consistency, he
throws it on the center of the wheel and begins to form it. The clay
leaps up at his touch as he shapes it.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Now as
clay in the hands of the potter, so am I in the hands of God. The wheel
on which the potter molds the clay is like the circumstances of my
life. The wheel is under the total control of the potter, and that's
all the clay needs to know. "It hurts!" the clay may complain. "I
wonder how much longer the potter will mold me. Won't he ever stop?"
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">God molds
me by ordaining the circumstances of my life. I submit to Him so that
He might work in me His eternal purposes. "I thank You, God, for all
the disappointments and losses that I have experienced." Paul says,
"The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with
the glory which shall be revealed in us" (Romans 8:18). "For our light
affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more
exceeding and eternal weight of glory" (II Corinthians 4:17).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">God's
work in your life may be painful right now, but He's aiming at the
eternal goal. He wants to bring you into a more glorious entrance into
His kingdom. Maybe He has to deprive you now of something that you feel
is so very important, but He overlooks your temporary ease for your
eternal interest. He has such wonderful things prepared, and He's
trying to lead us toward them. If only we would learn to flow with the
Spirit and be thankful in all things, because we belong to God. If we
live this way we'll never be disappointed.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Accepting
God's will for your life is like the little boy who built a model ship.
He carefully glued into place all the masts, riggings, and sails. After
months of labor he took it down to the pond and gently laid it on the
water. Proudly, he watched as the wind filled the sails and the little
boat sailed gracefully across the pond. Midway across the lake a strong
gust of wind knocked the sailboat over and it sank. The little boy
looked up and said, "Wow! What a great wind for flying a kite!" When
God stops you on one venture, be open to what He may have in mind.
Don't sit down and cry. He has something else for you to do. Look for
it!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">God often
has to deal with us severely, because we're not open and listening to
Him. We easily get into ruts with our well-ordered lives and stop
looking for what God wants us to have. "I'm at a good job, getting
seniority, and doing fine. This is terrific!" One day you go to work
and the foreman says, "Here's your termination notice."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Now it's,
"Lord! What are You doing to me? This is terrible!" God has a better
job for you, but you weren't looking for it. Now you are! God couldn't
bring you to the better position until He upset the old conditions. Now
you're open and listening to what God has to say. The Father delights
in giving good things to His children, just as a parent loves to give
some wonderful gift to his child.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">We have
one son who's always been difficult to please. Buy him a new shirt and
he'll say, "Does it match my slacks?" Buy him new shoes and he'll say,
"Why did you get that style?" Sometimes God has a hard time giving us
gifts, too. What a disappointment when you give a truly wonderful gift
to someone you love, and he or she barely acknowledges it. That isn't a
response anyone appreciates, especially God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">But
became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was
darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools
(1:21b-22). Our imaginations often focus on the empty things of the
world, and much of our mental power is exercised on vain fantasies. How
much better when our hearts and minds are filled with God, His Word,
and His love. The wisdom of the world is foolishness to God. Many times
we profess ourselves to be wise and actually become fools by the
theories that we believe and follow.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">And
changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to
corruptible man (1:23a). The men of the world tried to make an image of
God by fashioning it in the form of man.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">And to
birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things (1:23b). Have you
ever seen the grotesque images of past civilizations or the awful
images in India today that are worshipped as God? Quite often the
statues are part man and part animal. How tragic and foolish! Yet
people worship these things and say, "That's God. "
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Now we
come to the first "giving up" by God. Wherefore God also gave them up
to uncleanness [sexual uncleanness or impurity] through the lusts of
their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves
(1:24). Whenever man fashions an image of God in the form of a man, he
brings God even below his own level. When a man puts eyes and ears on
an idol, it still can't see or hear. Setting God below his own level
creates moral depravity in man, for he loses his high ideals and
becomes like his god. His god is less than man, thus his god becomes in
his mind a base creature.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The
ritual worship of false gods was often done through fertility rites and
practices. In Paul's time, the great temple of Aphrodite stood on the
Acropolis in Corinth. The priestesses of this temple were prostitutes
who came into the city nightly. The Corinthians "worshipped" Aphrodite
through sexual rites, and the profit supported their religion. Man
degrades himself whenever he worships anything other than the true and
living God. So, man is given up by God and given over to "uncleanness."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Who
changed the truth of God into a lie (1:25a). Man has to live with
himself, so he rationalizes his evil deeds in order to ease his
conscience. But to do that he has to change God. He challenges God's
Word and claims, "The Bible isn't really the inspired Word of God." Or
he underestimates Him. "God doesn't care. He isn't really concerned."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">In Paul's
day some men believed that the body was completely separate from God's
concern. These men taught that you must worship God in the realm of the
spirit, but you could do whatever you pleased with your body. Such a
teaching changes the truth of God into a lie, just to accommodate the
lusts of the flesh.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">And
worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator (1:25b). Men
are doing the same thing today as in Paul's day. They're worshipping
and serving the works of their own hands rather than the Creator of all
things. Idolatry, one of the most common of all sins, is the obsession
for the things made by men's hands. The idolater cannot rest until he
possesses the object of his desire. For this cause God gave them up
(1:26a).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul also
tells us that God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their
women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: and
likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in
their lust one toward another (1:26-27). Lesbianism and homosexuality
follow whenever God gives up women and men to the things they desire.
Don't tell me that God created a homosexual that way. That's changing
the truth of God into a lie. Man becomes perverted because he doesn't
want to retain God in his mind. He refuses to glorify God as God, and
he seeks to make a god after himself. God gives him up to these vile
affections, because he has rejected the truth of God within his own
heart.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">But if a
person will return and submit himself to the truth, Jesus will free him
from that power and manner of life. He came to set the captive free!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Even as
they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over
to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient [ought
not to be done]; being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication,
wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate,
deceit, malignity; whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, despiteful,
proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
without understanding, convenant breakers, without natural affection,
implacable, unmerciful (1:28-31).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">This
passage shows the sad picture of society today. People have sought to
rule God out of their consciences. So, God has given them up to these
vile practices. These sins will manifest themselves whenever a society
turns its back upon God and seeks independence from Him. Whoever
rejects Jesus Christ will find himself going downhill fast, doing
things he never dreamed of, and losing any scruples against doing them.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Who
knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are
worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that
do them (1:32). Many people hold a prideful view of themselves, as the
Pharisee who said, "God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men"
(Luke 18:11). They feel smug because they're innocent of some of the
grosser forms of sin. Yet, they go to a movie or watch a TV program as
actors portray these vile things, and they actually enjoy or "have
pleasure in them that do them." We need to take great care not to sow
to our flesh in any way. "For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the
flesh reap corruption" (Galatians 6:8).

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">There is
no break in Paul's writing between Chapters 1 and 2, and he continues
in the next verse, Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever
thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou
condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things (2:1).
We may judge someone else's sins, but so often we're guilty of the very
same act.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Watching
television and movies can be dangerous. Often a person receives
vicarious pleasure from watching the violence and corruption on the
screen. He wouldn't think of doing such things himself, but when he
sees them portrayed on a screen he drinks it all in. He's as guilty as
the people he's watching, because he's mentally indulging in the same
practices.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">But we
are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them
which commit such things (2:2). God's judgment will be according to
truth, because He'll judge not only men's actions but the motives that
prompted the actions.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Many
times after committing a crime, a man will make up an excuse to justify
what he's done. As he gives you his explanation, he sounds like he
really is innocent. However, he made up the story after the fact to
justify himself and avoid punishment.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">God told
Ezekiel, "Dig a hole through the wall, go in, and take a look around
the house of Israel." Ezekiel went in and saw many filthy pictures,
detestable animals, and idols upon the walls. The Lord said, "You're
seeing the insides of the minds of men" (Ezekiel 8:8-12).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Some day
you may stand before God in heaven saying, "I didn't intend to cause
any harm." He could say, "Let's review the thoughts that were in your
mind at that moment." The Bible says, "All things are naked and opened
unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do" (Hebrews 4:13b). You
can't hide from God. He knows the secret motives of your heart, and His
judgment will be according to the absolute truth.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Or
despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and
long-suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to
repentance? (2:4). Men so often mistake the patience of God as a
weakness or, worse yet, as approval. A man says, "If there is a God in
heaven, let Him strike me dead!" He shakes his fist at God. When he
isn't struck dead, he says, "I told you. There is no God." How foolish!
A person may be lulled into believing that God doesn't care or that He
even approves of his sins, because God's judgment isn't immediate. By
misinterpreting the patience of God as "getting by with it," a man
shows despite toward the goodness of God and fools himself.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The
goodness of God leads a man to repentance. So many times a preacher
tries to get a sinner to repent by shaking him over hell and
emphasizing the wrath of God. In reality, knowing how much he deserves
the judgment and wrath of God, yet realizing the goodness, forbearance,
and long-suffering of God, causes a man to repent.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The day
of judgment will come and all secrets will be revealed. But after thy
hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against
the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God (2:5).
That's why I pray, "Remember not the sins of my youth" (Psalm 25:7a).
That's why David prayed, "Have mercy upon me, O God... according unto
the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions" (Psalm
51:1). As a sinner David didn't say, "Have justice on me, O God."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">God will
render to every man according to his deeds (2:6). By continuing to sin,
a person is damming up a huge reservoir of judgment that will finally
burst and carry him off in the torrent. To them who by patient
continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality,
God will reward with eternal life. But unto them that are contentious,
and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and
wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil,
of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile; but glory, honour, and
peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to
the Gentile (2:7-10).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For there
is no respect of persons with God (2:11). In this particular
dispensation God deals equally with all men, Jews and Gentiles. If
you're following Christ, He'll bless and reward you. If you harden your
heart against Him by following your own path, then God will judge you
regardless of whether you're a Jew or a Gentile. Your nationality won't
make the day of judgment any easier for you, because God doesn't show
any favoritism.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For as
many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as
many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law (2:12). Those
who have never heard about Jesus Christ will be judged according to the
knowledge that they have had. If they didn't have the Law of Moses,
they'll be judged apart from the Law.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">(For not
the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law
shall be justified. For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do
by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law,
are a law unto themselves: which show the work of the law written in
their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts
the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another) (2:13-15).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">God has
given each person a basic sense of right and wrong. This standard is
written upon the tablet of his heart, and his thoughts are either
accusing or excusing him. What will God judge? The secrets of men by
Jesus Christ according to my gospel (2:16).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Behold,
thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of
God, and knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more
excellent, being instructed out of the law; and art confident that thou
thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in
darkness, an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast
the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law. Thou therefore which
teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man
should not steal, dost thou steal? thou that sayest a man should not
commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols,
dost thou commit sacrilege? thou that makest thy boast of the law,
through breaking the law dishonourest thou God? (2:17-23).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul was
addressing himself to the Jews who had the Law of Moses and were
boasting in it. "We have the Law and know the things that are right.
We're a light to those in darkness and a guide to the blind." The Jews
stood as the moral and spiritual teachers of the world.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">But Paul
said, "Wait a minute! You teach that a man shouldn't steal, but do you
covet your neighbor's goods? You teach that a man shouldn't commit
adultery, but do you think about it yourself? You teach that a man
shouldn't worship idols, but do you secretly worship idols in your
heart?"
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul was
pointing out that the true intent of the Law is to govern and judge the
attitudes of men more than their actions. This is the very thing that
Jesus pointed out in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5:17-18). Using
five examples, He showed how the Law was being misinterpreted by the
scribes and Pharisees and what God meant when He gave it. In each case,
the scribes were applying the Law to a man's actions when God was
judging his attitudes. The whole purpose of the Law was voided by their
misinterpretation.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">By
applying the Law only to actions, the scribes felt very self-righteous.
However, the Law's purpose was to make the whole world guilty before
God by revealing sin and, thus, drive men to the grace of God in Jesus
Christ. By misunderstanding the intent of the Law, the reaction of the
scribes in their smugness and self-righteousness was exactly the
opposite of what God intended.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">As a
result, the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you,
as it is written. For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the
law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made
uncircumcision (2:24-25). The Jews were trusting in the Mosaic ritual
of circumcision for their salvation, but their disobedience of the
spirit of the Law invalidated the ritual.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">It's
wrong to trust in a ritual such as baptism for salvation.
Unfortunately, the so-called salvation of many people is based on the
water sprinkled on their heads as infants. These people don't even
remember the event, but they have a certificate that proves it
happened. Such a religious ritual is meaningless in terms of salvation.
Our relationship with God is totally dependent upon a living, active
faith in Jesus Christ.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">You may
say, "When I was baptized, they put me all the way under. None of that
sprinkling for me!" If you're not walking according to God's will, you
can't trust in the ritual, even if you were baptized in the deepest
ocean. Your heart determines your salvation, and your present life can
invalidate the meaning of any ritual you may have experienced.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul says
that the benefit of circumcision is removed by disobedience to the Law
of God. For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if
thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.
Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law,
shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? (2:25-26).
The crucial issue isn't ritual but obedience to God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Personally,
I don't agree with any denomination claiming that a person cannot be
saved until he is baptized. Does baptism save? No. The work of God in a
man's heart is what counts. Salvation rests upon the work of Jesus
Christ on the Cross.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">And shall
not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge
thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law? For
he is not a Jew which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision,
which is outward in the flesh: but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly;
and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the
letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God (2:27-29).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Circumcision
was intended to signify a people who would deny their flesh and live
after the Spirit. The significance of the rite could be totally negated
by a man if he continued to live after the flesh. Likewise, baptism
symbolizes the death of the old nature and the new life of the Spirit.
The proof of this work of God is in a person's life, not in the ritual.

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">What
advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?
(3:1). If circumcision can't get me points in heaven, then what
advantage do I have as a Jew? Paul said, Much every way: chiefly,
because that unto them were committed the oracles of God (3:2). God
committed His Word to the Jews in their native language. Those who read
Hebrew could read God's Word.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">We owe a
great deal to the Jews for preserving the Word of God with such
diligence and accuracy. Prior to the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls
in 1947, the oldest complete Hebrew manuscript of the Old Testament was
dated about A.D. 900. The Dead Sea Isaiah Scroll is dated about 200
B.C. When the Isaiah Scroll was translated, it was found to have no
major changes from the text we already possessed. The Jewish scribes
had faithfully and accurately copied the Word of God throughout the Old
Testament period.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">What if
some [of them] did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of
God without effect? (3:3). This is an interesting speculation. A man
may claim to be an unbeliever. That doesn't change the truth. Suppose
that he went into a math class. The teacher had written on the board,
"2 + 2 = 4". He says, "Wait a minute! I don't believe that two plus two
equals four." His opinion won't change the fact. Whether he believes or
not doesn't alter the truth.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The truth
will stand, and it isn't without effect because a person doesn't
believe it. Similarly, a man cannot add to God by accepting the truth.
When a sinner repents and accepts Christ, God doesn't say, "Goody!
Another one on our side." He doesn't need us. He can live very well
without us. He loves us, and because He loves us He draws us unto
Himself. We're the ones who gain and are blessed. It's so wonderful
that God pursues this relationship with us when He has nothing to gain
by it.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For what
if some did not believe? Shall their unbelief make the faith of God
without effect? God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar;
as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and
mightest overcome when thou art judged. But if our unrighteousness
commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous
who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man) (3:3-5).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">A person
may claim, "God said that we're all sinners in Romans 3:23. By being a
sinner I'm only proving that God told the truth. Why should God take
vengeance on me because I'm proving His truth?" Oh, the stupid
reasoning of man! How often we find ourselves facing these nonsensical
arguments. Paul said, God forbid [perish the thought]: for then how
shall God judge the world? For if the truth of God hath more abounded
through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
(3:6-7).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Some
preachers tell stories packed with emotion in an attempt to turn people
to Christ. There's no truth to the story, but it's persuasive and turns
people from their sins. Some might say, "Why would God judge a preacher
for lying? Look at the good that has come from it." But the end doesn't
justify the means. Jesus said, "Many will say to me in that day, Lord,
Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out
devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I
profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work
iniquity" (Matthew 7:22-23).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Some
Christians were slanderously reported to have said, "Let us do evil
that good may come." Paul characterized such people as those whose
damnation is just (3:8). The evil of man and the righteousness of God
stand in brilliant contrast. Take the case of Tex Watson, a convicted
murderer and former member of the Charles Manson family. Tex Watson is
now a brother in Christ. How his conversion magnifies the grace of God.
But should we do wicked things so we can magnify the grace of God?
Never! One of the most glorious of all testimonies is obeying God's
will. That kind of testimony thrills God's heart.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">What
then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before
proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin; as it is
written, There is none righteous, no, not one (3:9-10).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul goes on to describe these deceivers who encouraged evil so that more of God's grace would be given.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">There is
none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. They are
all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there
is none that doeth good, no, not one. Their throat is an open
sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps
is under their lips: whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:
their feet are swift to shed blood: destruction and misery are in their
ways: and the way of peace have they not known: there is no fear of God
before their eyes. Now we know that what things soever the law saith,
it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be
stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. Therefore by
the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight:
for by the law is the knowledge of sin (3:11-20).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">No one
can be justified by the Law of Moses, the Ten Commandments. We're
already guilty before we even start. The Law wasn't given to justify
us, but to expose our innate sinfulness. It reveals the fact that the
whole world is guilty before God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The Jews
had misinterpreted the Law to such an extent that they felt
self-righteous. The religious leaders were teaching that a man could
actually keep the Law, because their idea of obedience was by outward
observance only. But in the Sermon on the Mount Jesus pointed out that
the Law was spiritual and that all men had already violated it. Jesus
showed that the Law governs the inner attitudes of men as well as their
outward actions. Though the Jews' actions may have been blameless,
their attitudes were evil. For example, though they hadn't committed
adultery, they had lusted in their hearts. So, they were guilty of
violating the Law.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The Law
condemns all of us, and it points all of us to the only hope of
salvation that we have - the grace and mercy of God and the forgiveness
of our sins through Jesus Christ.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">But now
the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed
by the law and the prophets; even the righteousness of God which is by
faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for
there is no difference (3:21-22). No difference exists between Jew and
Gentile in terms of salvation. Each one who believes in Jesus Christ is
justified from all the sins he has ever committed.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">"Justified"
is a beautiful word meaning "just as if I never did it." When I stand
before Him cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ, God looks at me as
though the disobedience and sins of the past had never happened. God
credits my faith in Him as righteousness. My hope is in the sustaining
power and grace of God through His Holy Spirit. Jesus said, "I am the
vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the
same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing" (John
15:5). Apart from Christ I have no justification before God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">When I
abide in Christ, my salvation and relationship with God doesn't vary.
Years ago my relationship with Him was unstable in my own mind, because
I tried to make it depend upon my good works. As a child I was taught
that I shouldn't go to movies, dance, smoke cigarettes, or drink
liquor. So I have abstained from all those things, but as a child I
couldn't understand why God was blessing some kids at church more than
He was blessing me. They were sneaking off to the Saturday matinee and
smoking cigarettes. "God, I'm so good and they're such sneaks!" I was
approaching God on the basis of my good works, but I wasn't so good in
my thoughts. When the other kids were heading to the matinee, I really
wanted to see Pinocchio or Snow White with them. How I wished I hadn't
been brought up in that strict church. I longed for those things in my
heart, but I wouldn't do them.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">My Sunday
school teachers told me the story of a little boy who went to the
movies and said, "Jesus, please wait outside. I'll be back in about an
hour and a half." I was told never to go anywhere I couldn't take the
Lord. "If the Lord should come while you're at the movies, He'll leave
you behind. When you come out, you may find the Church is raptured and
you've been left." The first movie I finally went to see was agony. The
whole time I thought, "What if the Lord comes while I'm sitting here?
What if the rapture takes place?" I wanted to get up and leave!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Eventually,
God in His grace caused me to realize that true righteousness isn't
based on rules but on my faith in Jesus Christ. My relationship with
God then stabilized. I certainly don't do the right thing in every
situation. For example, I don't always tolerate abuse and won't always
turn the other cheek. Thank God that my faults don't alter my faith in
Jesus. I still believe in Him and love Him with all my heart. When I do
wrong He speaks to me about it, and He teaches me to lean a little
harder on Him instead of on myself.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">God has
brought me into a new righteousness based upon His faithfulness to keep
His Word. There's never a problem on that basis, because I know that
God is faithful and will always keep His word.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For all
have sinned, and come short of the glory of God (3:23). Some may come
closer than others, but all have come short of God's standard. As an
illustration, suppose that we're sailing to Hawaii and the boat
capsizes midway. We start swimming for shore. Some are very weak
swimmers and sink within the first hundred yards. Some don't go down
until the first mile. Some are strong enough to swim five miles before
they go down. But all come short of reaching land.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Being
justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ
Jesus (3:24). We can only be justified before God by His grace in the
redemption purchased for us by Jesus Christ.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Whom God
has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to
declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past,
through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time his
righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which
believeth in Jesus (3:25-26).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">In order
to forgive you, God must have a just basis of forgiveness. That basis
of forgiveness is the substitution of Christ for you, the sinner. Jesus
took your sins and bore your guilt. God had declared, "The soul that
sinneth, it shall die" (Ezekiel 18:20). Jesus died in your place and
bore the judgment of your guilt. Thus, He can offer the forgiveness of
your sins and the cleansing of your past. He can justify you before God
of any wrong you have ever done. That's God's good news. Paul said,
"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of
God unto salvation" (Romans 1:16a).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Where is
boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the
law of faith. Therefore, we conclude that a man is justified by faith
without the deeds of the law (3:27-28). Salvation is by faith and it
completely eliminates any boasting by us.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">And when, before the throne, I stand in Him complete,
<br>"Jesus died my soul to save," my lips shall still repeat.
<br>Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe;
<br>Sin had left a crimson stain,
<br>He washed it white as snow. [1]
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">What a
glorious day it will be when Jesus presents me "faultless before the
presence of his glory with exceeding joy" (Jude 24b). I won't be able
to say, "I was such a faithful and strong Christian! I really held on
to the end!" No! Boasting is eliminated, because my salvation has
become God's work.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The Bible
says, "Ye are complete in him" (Colossians 2:10a). "Complete" means
"perfect" You can't improve on perfection. Having begun in the Spirit,
you must continue to walk in faith. God sees you in that state of
perfection as you abide in Christ.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Is he the
God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the
Gentiles also: seeing it is one God, who shall justify the circumcision
by faith, and uncircumcision through faith (3:29-30). The Jews thought
that they possessed God exclusively. Not so. All men may approach God
now. The rituals of the past no longer matter, for faith in Christ is
the key to justification.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">However,
faith doesn't cancel the Law of Moses. It actually supports the purpose
of the Law. Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid:
yea, we establish the law (3:31). The Law was given to show that all
the world stands guilty before God. Salvation by faith eliminates all
human boasting and shows us that we cannot save ourselves by works.
Faith brings us to the same realization as the Law, and so it
establishes the Law.

  </tr>
</tbody></table>
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">In Chapter
4 of Romans Paul talks about the righteousness that God has established
through faith. This righteousness isn't accomplished by outward
obedience to the Law of Moses, but upon the principle of faith.
Righteousness through faith eliminates any boasting on man's behalf.
"Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay:
but by the law of faith" (Romans 3:27).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">My
salvation is a work of God. I can't boast in my own works, because my
salvation is God's work in me. He did it and I believed it. God counts
my faith in the righteousness of Christ as my own righteousness.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">In
Chapter 4 Paul also emphasizes that justification by faith isn't a new
concept with God. He explains that God had established the principle of
faith with Abraham, the father of the Jewish nation, long before the
Mosaic Law was ever given.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">What
shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh,
hath found? (4:1). What did Abraham, the physical father of the Jews,
discover about faith and justification?
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For if
Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not
before God. For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it
was counted unto him for righteousness (4:2-3). If Abraham was
justified by obediently leaving his home by Babylon to look for the
Promised Land or by offering his son Isaac as a sacrifice, then he
would have been able to boast in himself. He could have said, "I left
my home and was willing to give up everything, even my son, to follow
God. I'm really righteous!" However, Abraham was justified solely by
faith, not by works.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">This same
principle of justification by faith is true in our own salvation. If we
were justified by our works, we could glory in ourselves and, thus, our
boasting wouldn't be in God's work. For this reason Paul said, "God
forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ"
(Galatians 6:14a). Our only place of boasting is in the Cross. Jesus
said, "So you also, when you have done everything you were commanded to
do, should say, We are unworthy servants, for we have done only what
was our duty" (Luke 17:10).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Glory for
my salvation should always be given to God, yet my flesh delights in
self-glory. How I'd love to take credit for my salvation, and I keep
trying! Every time I say, "God, there must be some good in me
somewhere!" He lets me fall flat on my face. There's nothing in my
flesh about which I can glory.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul
repeats this same truth in Chapter 7. "I know that in me (that is, in
my flesh) dwelleth no good thing" (Romans 7:18a). If you haven't
discovered this fact yet, you will. God doesn't plan to redeem your
flesh; He condemns your flesh to the Cross. He must change you from
this corruptible body into an incorruptible one before you can enter
into the eternal kingdom. "This corruptible [perishable] must put on
incorruption [imperishable], and this mortal must put on immortality"
(I Corinthians 15:53).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Even when
I know that no good dwells in my flesh, I often say, "Lord, surely I
can conquer this problem. Give me a chance and I'll do better. I
promise that I won't fail again." Every promise of doing better and
being more faithful is doomed to failure, because it's rooted in the
confidence of my flesh. My boasting and confidence must be in Jesus
Christ and His finished work for me.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The
concept of righteousness by faith is quite foreign to us. We often
attempt to achieve righteousness by the do's and don'ts of Christian
behavior, and we're soon legislating our own religious laws. Since
there are always amendments and modifications, the list eventually
becomes so long that no one can keep up with it.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">If I have
followed the rule of keeping my temper and have blessed others when I
was abused, I feel very confident and begin to boast of conquering
another area of my old nature. I feel very good, until I lose my cool
and yell at my kids. Then I cry, "O God! I'm a miserable failure! I
promised that I'd never do that again." I now feel so miserable and
alienated from God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Why did
God establish the principle of righteousness by faith? It's the only
way that my relationship with Him can remain constant in spite of my
human failures.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The
Mosaic Law failed to bring righteousness because its benefits depended
upon man's obedience. "The man who obeys them will live by them"
(Leviticus 18:5). The Law's fulfillment was based on man's flesh, but
his flesh is weak. The Law didn't fail. Man failed. So God has
established a new basis for righteousness: faith in Jesus Christ. Jesus
has promised to cleanse a man from all sin and to present him faultless
before the Father.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">This New
Covenant is based on God's faithfulness to keep His word. I fulfill my
part of the bargain by trusting in God through faith in Jesus Christ.
My righteous standing is complete once I stop trying to justify myself
before God and rest where God is resting - in the finished work of
Jesus Christ. (The Bible explains more about this "rest" in Hebrews 4.)
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Now to
him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt
(4:4). If righteousness was credited to a man for his works, then God
would owe him the reward of salvation. The Jehovah's Witnesses believe
that they can work for their righteousness by door-to-door witnessing.
Trusting in a righteousness that goes back to the Law, they seek to put
God in debt to them. However, God will never be any man's debtor.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">When I
work for an employer, he is legally obligated to pay me my wages. But a
right relationship with God is a gift that I do not, cannot, and never
will deserve. This gift demonstrates the grace of God, as He gives me
what I could never earn: perfect righteousness.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">But to
him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly,
his faith is counted for righteousness (4:5). Some people may look at
this statement as almost heretical, but it's scriptural. They may
protest that justification by faith is a dangerous thing to preach.
"Christians will become lazy. They'll sit around believing in the Lord
and do nothing." However, it's impossible to believe in Jesus Christ
and do nothing. True faith will spark a tremendous response in a man.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The works
of a Christian are in no way intended to make him holier or more
righteous before God. One of the curses in the Church throughout the
centuries has been the holier-than-thou attitude. They come to you with
dreamy eyes and say, "Brother, are you ready for the secrets of God
that have been made known to me?" That super-spiritual attitude is a
curse among Christians.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">My works
don't add a whit to my righteousness. God has imputed to me the
righteousness of Jesus Christ, and trying to improve on it is sheer
folly. The fullness of the Godhead bodily dwells in Christ, and I'm
complete in Him. (Colossians 2:9-10)
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Then what
are my works as a believer? Just the glorious and natural response of
my heart to the goodness, grace, and love of God. Paul said, "The love
of Christ constraineth [compels] me" (II Corinthians 5:14). Love drives
me to do whatever I can for Him.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Love is
the highest motivating force, and it's the only acceptable motive for
any true service for God. If love doesn't motivate me in my service for
God, I might as well stop. If I think that my Christian service is
making me holier or more righteous than others, I'm badly mistaken.
"And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give
my body to be burned, and have not love, it profiteth me nothing" (I
Corinthians 13:3).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Many
times the urgings from the pulpit prompt people to serve the Lord for
rewards. I was guilty of doing that for years. "I'll give you a giant
lollipop if you bring ten kids to Sunday school." However, the entire
work-reward concept is carnal, not spiritual. By appealing to this
carnal motive, many pastors have created a spirit of competitiveness
within their congregations. Though a person may work himself to death,
he'll receive nothing for his carnal efforts, except perhaps some
personal glory and applause when he collects his giant lollipop.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Not
striving to do God's work doesn't mean that I'm spiritually lazy. It
usually means that I'm doing more than ever, but my motivation is God's
great love. Rewards could never have prompted me to do the things I've
done. As Paul said, "Neither count I my life dear unto myself" (Acts
20:24a). To please and serve Christ becomes the joy, desire, and
delight of my life, because He loves me so much.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Even as
David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God
imputeth righteousness without works, saying, Blessed are they whose
iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man
to whom the Lord will not impute sin (4:6-8). The word "blessed" means
"Oh, how happy!" How happy is the man to whom the Lord will not impute
iniquity.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Did you
know that God no longer charges sin against you if you're believing in
Jesus Christ? "If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have
fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son
continually cleanses us from all sin... If any man sin, we have an
advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and he is the
propitiation for our sins" (I John 1:7, 2:1b-2a).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Cometh
this blessedness then upon the circumcision only? (4:9a). Is this
blessedness of divine forgiveness just for the Jew? Or in
uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision (4:10b). To
the Jews circumcision was the most important ritual that a man could
experience. According to their teaching, God wouldn't accept an
uncircumcised man. Yet Paul says that faith, not circumcision, gave
Abraham his standing before God. God credited his faith for
righteousness while Abraham was still uncircumcised.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">And he
received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the
faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father
of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that
righteousness might be imputed unto them [Gentiles] also: and the
father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only,
but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham,
which he had being yet uncircumcised (4:11-12).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">God has
imparted perfect righteousness to me, a sinner, totally apart from
works and rituals. The bread and wine of the Lord's Supper are only a
memorial. They will not save me. The water of baptism is only a symbol.
It will not save me. Salvation is the work of God within my heart
through faith in Jesus Christ alone.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For the
promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham,
or to his seed, through the law (4:13a). Abraham lived 400 years before
the Mosaic Law was given. His righteousness must have been apart from
the Law, since the Law didn't even exist yet.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">But
through the righteousness of faith. For if they which are of the law be
heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect: because
the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression
(4:13b-15). A man can't transgress a law that doesn't exist. So,
mankind couldn't violate the Law until it had been given.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Therefore
it [our righteousness] is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the
end the promise might be sure (4:16a). A righteousness predicated upon
your works could never be sure. Neither could it be sure if it depended
upon your faithfulness. Because God wants you to be assured of your
salvation, He promises to save you if you'll just believe in His Son
Jesus Christ and His finished work for you on the cross. Salvation
isn't premised on your works but on His work, not on your faithfulness
but on His faithfulness. Only thus can your salvation be sure.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The
guarantee of your salvation is certain. You don't need to constantly
worry yourself with doubts and questions, such as, "Did I confess
everything today? Forgive everybody? Love everybody? If I go to sleep
and die tonight, will I find myself in hell?" Not knowing for certain
whether you're saved would be miserable. Your attitude would be, "I
hope I've done my best. I hope I haven't sinned. I hope..." You'd never
have any confidence in your salvation, whereas God wants you to have
confidence and certainty. So, He has established His New Covenant on
the basis of faith in the complete work of Christ. Your salvation is
secure and you don't have to worry, because Jesus has covered your sins
of the past, present, and future.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">To the
end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which
is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who
is the father of us all (4:16). Abraham is my father not in an ethnic
but in a spiritual sense. He's the father of all who believe in God and
are accounted righteous by their faith in Christ.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">(As it is
written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he
believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things
which be not as though they were (4:17).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Long
before Abraham had fathered Isaac, God spoke to him as though his son
already existed. I'm greatly comforted when God speaks about me as
righteous, justified, glorified, holy, pure, and sanctified completely.
God can talk about such things before they exist, because He knows they
will exist. Jesus Christ will present me before the Father
"faultless... with exceeding joy" (Jude 24). In the Bible God talks
about my future state as a certainty. My dwelling with Him eternally is
a fact to Him, just as Abraham's unborn son was a fact. Abraham against
hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations,
according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be (4:18).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">We now
come to the four keys of Abraham's faith. And being not weak in faith,
he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred
years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb (4:19). Ignoring
the physical limitations of the situation was the first key of
Abraham's faith.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Whenever
I'm faced with a problem, I usually try to work out my own solution. As
long as I can devise a plan, I feel confident. However, when a
situation seems to have no solution, I start to worry. If I can't
figure it out, how will God be able to solve it?
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">So often
when I've worked out a possible solution in my mind, I then begin to
direct God in my prayers according to my planned solution. At this
point my prayers become direction prayers rather than direct prayers.
God does answer prayer, but He often refuses to follow my directions.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Too often
we trust in human evaluations and the analysis from the laboratory. Is
the tumor malignant? The report says that it's benign, so we praise the
Lord. But should word of malignancy come, we panic and give up all
hope. We're only seeing the human possibilities.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Sarah
could have called on the doctor and said, "My husband and I want a son
of our own. However, I went through menopause about 30 years ago."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The doctor would have said, "Sarah, you're dreaming!"
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Can you
imagine Abraham coming in for his annual check-up saying, "Sarah and I
want a son. Can you give us some vitamins or something?"
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">"No
chance," the doctor says. "You're almost 100 years old and your wife is
past 90. A son now? Abraham, forget it. That's humanly impossible!"
God's promise to Abraham was humanly impossible to fulfill, but Abraham
simply ignored the natural considerations.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">When God
is the working agent, any talk of limitations or difficulty is absurd.
For example, consider the events in II Kings 7:1-20. When the Syrians
besieged the city of Samaria and cut off all their supplies, the
conditions became hopeless. The people, starving to death, resorted to
eating their own children. A donkey's head sold for 80 shekels on about
two pounds of silver.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">When the
king and his officer visited the home of Elisha, the prophet promised a
complete reversal of circumstances. He said, "Tomorrow, about this
time, a seah [seven quarts] of flour will sell for a shekel [65 cents]
and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria. "
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The
king's officer said, "Elisha, even if the Lord would make windows in
heaven, could such a thing ever be?" The prophet replied, "Behold, you
will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat it." Such a
provision sounded so impossible under the circumstances that the
officer didn't believe it.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Such is
the price of unbelief. It robs you of the blessings God has already
provided. So often we look for the ways that God might work - "If God
would open windows in heaven" - but we don't need to understand the
ways of the Lord. All we need is to believe and trust in Him.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The
second key to Abraham's faith was not staggering in unbelief at the
promises of God. He staggered not at the promise of God through
unbelief (4:20a). How many times we stagger at God's promises through
unbelief! God's promises often seem too good to be true. I can accept
what God did for Elijah and Paul, but I can't believe that He would do
it for me.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The Bible
says, "He has given us exceeding great and precious promises" (II Peter
1:4a). One of these promises is "My God will meet all your needs
according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus" (Philippians 4:19).
The promises of God are so great that our belief in them is prone to
waver, and we hesitate rather than confidently claim them.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Abraham
didn't waver, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God (4:20b).
This was the third key to Abraham's faith. He was praising and thanking
God for a son even before Sarah was pregnant.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Years ago
while pastoring in another area, I was working at a supermarket to meet
the family's needs. We had three children and the church only paid
twenty dollars a week.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">My
mother-in-law had died in Phoenix, and we went there to take care of
the funeral arrangements. While I was gone my union dues at the
supermarket lapsed. When I returned to pay them, the union had attached
a fifty dollar fine. I couldn't afford to pay the fine plus the dues. I
was in a bind, because the union wouldn't let me work, and I couldn't
get the money without the work.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Since my
income from the supermarket had stopped, things were pretty tough and I
became discouraged. I've always believed in keeping my accounts up to
date as a witness for Jesus Christ. Now for the first time in my life I
started receiving letters from my creditors.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">One
morning I got up and totaled our debts. They came to $416.00. I laid
them before the Lord, but I was very disheartened. "Where in the world
am I ever going to get $416.00?" About that time the phone rang. I
picked it up, and a friend said, "Chuck, I'm calling to let you know
that I put a check in the mail for you. I sent it special delivery, and
you should get it tomorrow morning. It's for $425.00."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Was I
ever elated! I ran into the kitchen, grabbed my wife, and danced her
around the room. I was praising the Lord. "Victory! Bless God!
Hallelujah! We'll be out of debt! We even have enough money to go out
for dinner!"
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Later, after I had settled down again, God began speaking to me. "How do you know that he sent the money to you?"
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">"Lord, I've known my friend for many years. He wouldn't call me unless he'd done it. I trust his word, Lord."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">"Very
interesting," said the Lord. "You had My word this morning that I would
provide the money, but I didn't see you dancing your wife around the
kitchen. Instead, you were down in the mouth and blue. Now that you
have a man's word for the money, you're all excited. Tell Me, whose
word is greater?" I had to repent. My faith didn't include praising God
for His promise before it was fulfilled.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">We often
become defeated and discouraged even though we have God's guarantee of
victory and success. Abraham was strong in faith and gave glory to God
before Sarah conceived, because he had the promise of God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The final
key to Abraham's faith was being fully persuaded that, what he had
promised, he was able also to perform (4:21). How big is your God? Is
your God able? Many times God is too small for our problems, because He
is the product of our imaginations.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The God
of the Scriptures is eternal and almighty. He measures the heavens with
the span of His hand, and to Him "the nations are as a drop of a
bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance" (Isaiah
40:12,15). Oh, the greatness of the God we serve! "Now unto him that is
able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think"
(Ephesians 3:20a). Abraham simply believed that God would fulfill His
promises, and therefore it [his faith] was imputed [credited] to him
for righteousness (4:22).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Now it
was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; but for
us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised
up Jesus our Lord from the dead; who was delivered for our offences,
and was raised again for our justification (4:23-25).

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Therefore
being justified by faith, we have peace with God (5:1a). "Justified"
means "just as if I never did it." The first result of justification by
faith is peace with God. If justification depended on my works, some
days this peace would be present and some days not, depending on my
performance.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">We have
peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we have
access by faith into this grace wherein we stand (5:1b-2a). The second
result of justification by faith is access to God. The door is always
open. If we were righteous by our works, then the door would usually be
closed because of our failures. Our relationship with God is
established on His faithfulness to His promises and on our belief that
He'll keep His word.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Satan has
bound up many people by accusing them of a lack of righteousness by
works. When we begin to pray for a need, he comes and says, "A fine one
you are! You pray when you're in trouble, but where were you all week
when things were going well? You ought to be ashamed of yourself. God
isn't going to listen!" Satan troubles us constantly by claiming that
the door is closed. "God doesn't want you to come. You failed to be
righteous."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">However,
my righteousness isn't based on keeping laws but on my belief in Jesus
Christ. The door is never closed, even after I've been a miserable
failure. I come to Him through the righteousness given me by faith in
Jesus Christ, and I can be confident of my standing with God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">And [we] rejoice in hope of the glory of God (5:2b). God's glory will be revealed in my life, and I rejoice in that!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">And not
only so, but we glory in tribulations also (5:3a). This verse defines
real spiritual growth. To rejoice in the hope of His glory is much
easier than rejoicing in tribulations. Can I be glad even in hardship?
Yes, when I know that my life is governed by God and that this hardship
is producing patience, one of the greatest needs in my life. "Ye have
need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might
receive the promise" (Hebrews 10:36).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">I've
heard people advise others against praying for patience because God
will then send them tribulations. If that's the way patience comes
then, "God, bring on the troubles." I need patience!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Difficult
times cause me to seek God. When all is well, I don't always respond to
Him immediately; but when I'm in trouble, I want God now. David prayed
much the same way when he was in difficulty. "Answer me speedily"
(Psalm 102:2b).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Tribulation
worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope
(5:3b-4). In my difficulty I begin to realize that God will provide
relief, perhaps not as soon as I'd like, but in His time. Thus, the
experience of trusting in Him during tribulation produces hope within
me.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">And hope
maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our
hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. For when we were yet
without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly (5:5-6). It's
important for us to note our condition when God loved us and allowed
His Son to die for us "ungodly." We find it difficult to get away from
the idea that we must be good so God will love us. God's love for us
stems from His nature, not our lovableness.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For
scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure [perhaps]
for a good man some would even dare to die. But God commendeth
[demonstrates] his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners,
Christ died for us (5:7-8). If Christ had died only for good people, we
could understand His dying for them. However, Jesus didn't die for the
honorable and upright. He died for the ungodly and sinners. By this act
God displayed His unconditional love for us.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Much more
then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath
through him (5:9). If Christ died for us while we were still sinners in
rebellion against God, how much more is He willing to save us from the
wrath to come?
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For if,
when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his
Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life (5:10).
These "much mores" are wonderful. While still an enemy of God I was
reconciled to Him through the blood of Jesus Christ. If His death could
reconcile me as an enemy, how much more will His life establish this
loving relationship between God and me.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">And not
only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom
we have now received the atonement (5:11). The Old and New Testament
words translated "atonement" differ in meaning. Atonement in Hebrew is
"kaphar", which means "covering." The Old Testament sacrifices of goats
and bulls covered sin but didn't put away sin. The Greek New Testament
word for atonement, "katallage", literally means "making one" and would
be better translated "reconciliation." Becoming one with God was
impossible through the Old Testament sacrifices; it took the sacrifice
of Jesus Christ to reconcile man with God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Wherefore,
as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so
death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned (5:12). The word
"have" is added in the King James Version; the original Greek reads,
"...because all sinned." Paul is saying that when Adam sinned, he
sinned for the whole human race. Just as Adam became a sinful creature,
spiritually dead and separated from God, so did his children. Adam
couldn't pass along any fellowship with God to his children, because he
had lost it; and because he acted as our federal head, we came into
this world separated from God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">(For
until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there
is no law (5:13). Though sin was in the world before Moses gave the
Law, it wasn't imputed to men until then.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Nevertheless
death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned
after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him
that was to come (5:14). Physical death came as the result of spiritual
death. Though God wasn't imputing sin to men before the Law, sin was
present through Adam. Death reigned because he sinned for us all.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">A
dangerous doctrine taught by Jehovah's Witnesses and other groups is
that Adam only sinned for himself. This view takes away the truth that
Paul brings out: since by one man's sin all could be made sinners, then
by one man's righteousness all can be made righteous (see Romans 5:19).
This corollary is the basis of the doctrine of justification by faith.
One man can act for an entire body of people, as Adam acted for the
entire human race when he sinned. Even so the second Adam, Jesus
Christ, acted for all of us in His righteousness. It is imputed to all
of us who believe in Him. If one man couldn't have sinned for all, then
one man couldn't be righteous for all. If that were the case, we would
have to establish our own righteousness. That would leave us out in the
cold, because "our righteous acts are as filthy rags" in the eyes of
God (Isaiah 64:6).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The
doctrine that sin passed upon all of us by one man, Adam, is vitally
important. I continually warn against the pernicious heresy that says a
man is a sinner because he has sinned. Such a concept implies that a
man could possibly live and die without sinning. Thus, he wouldn't need
Christ. The biblical revelation teaches that a man has sinned because
he is a sinner. "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by
sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned"
(5:12).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">But not
as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of
one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace,
which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many (5:15). If
one man can make us guilty before God, then how much more can Jesus
Christ through God's grace make us righteous.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">And not
as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by
one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto
justification. For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much
more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of
righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ) (5:16-17).
Death reigned from Adam. Life reigns from Christ. If one man can cause
the world to die, then how much more can the triumph of Jesus over
death bring life to those in Him. "And whosoever liveth and believeth
in me shall never die. Believest thou this?" (John 11:26).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Therefore
as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation;
even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men
unto justification of life (5:18). Adam's sin brought condemnation to
all men. Christ's sacrifice brought justification to all who believe.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For as by
one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of
one shall many be made righteous. Moreover the law entered, that the
offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more
abound: that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign
through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord
(5:19-21).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Thank God
for the abounding grace! One version translates verse 20 as "Where sin
did abound, grace overflowed." We seem to have great difficulty
accepting the grace of God. We're always trying to give God a reason to
love us, accept us, or forgive us. But God loves, accepts, and forgives
those who are miserable, rotten, and without merit. All we must do is
cast ourselves upon Him and cry, "God, be merciful to me a sinner." To
him who does not work but simply believes, God imputes his faith for
righteousness (Romans 4:5). God accounts me just as righteous as His
own dear Son.

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">What shall
we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? (6:1).
Since grace overflows wherever sin abounds, should we live in sin so we
might see more of the abounding grace of God? Perish the thought!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">God
forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?
(6:2). Here Paul states a fundamental principle about our walk with
Christ. The new life in Christ has brought death to the old. "If any
man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away;
behold, all things are become new" (II Corinthians 5:17). We're dead to
sin so we might be alive to God through the Spirit. How can a
Spirit-filled being live any longer in sin?
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Know ye
not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were
baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism
into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the
glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life
(6:34). When you went down in the waters of baptism, you were actually
buried with Christ. As you came up from the waters, you were a new
creature - ruled no longer by the flesh but by the Spirit.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For if we
have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be
also in the likeness of his resurrection: knowing this, that our old
man was [past tense in the Greek] crucified with him, that the body of
sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin
(6:5-6). The word translated "destroyed" means "put out of business."
My body of sin has been put out of business! If I want forgiveness for
my sins, I must see Christ on the cross dying for me. If I want power
over sin in my life, I must see myself crucified and risen again with
Him.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul
said, "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but
Christ liveth in me" (Galatians 2:20a). Your old flesh-dominated nature
was crucified, died, and was buried with Christ. Now you're living
after the Spirit-dominated life. As a child of God, you cannot serve
sin and follow after the weakness of your flesh. God has freed you from
its tyranny, and you need to reckon your old nature as dead.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For he
that is dead is freed from sin. Now if we be dead with Christ, we
believe that we shall also live with him: knowing that Christ being
raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over
him. For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth,
he liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead
indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord
(6:7-1 1).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">We're to
reckon ourselves to be dead unto sin. The word "reckon" means "to
account." This accounting is a position of faith. As long as we're in
this body of flesh, we have to deal with our flesh which desires to
rule over us. Our old nature was crucified with Christ, and we
constantly have to assert this position of faith. Crucifixion is a slow
and tortuous death, as the flesh doesn't die easily. So, the two
positions of faith we must take are that the old sinful nature is dead
and that we're now spiritually alive unto God through Christ.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Let not
sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the
lusts thereof (6:12). Man is an inferior trinity made of body, soul,
and spirit. These are set in a vertical order. In the natural man the
body is on top, dominating the soul (mind), and the spirit lies
underneath, dead, because it's alienated from God. When a man becomes
born again by the Spirit, his spirit comes alive and takes reign over
the soul, and the desires of the body yield to the spirit. The true
child of God is no longer ruled by his flesh.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Neither
yield ye your members as instruments [tools or weapons] of
unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that
are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of
righteousness unto God (6:13). You have the option of serving the flesh
or the Spirit. As a child of God you must yield to the influences of
the Spirit and allow your body to be an instrument in God's hands.
Don't let the flesh reign over you anymore.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For sin
shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but
under grace (6:14). Grace is the basis of your new relationship with
God, and sin does not and cannot have dominion over you.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">What
then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace?
God forbid. Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to
obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death,
or of obedience unto righteousness? (6:15-16). If you yield to the lust
of the flesh, you cannot be a servant of God. You'll become enslaved by
your flesh, and it will rule your life, eventually destroying you.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">When Adam
yielded to temptation and ate of the forbidden fruit, he obeyed Satan's
suggestion and became his servant. No man can serve two masters. We
cannot serve God and mammon (Matthew 6:24). As we walk in obedience to
God, we become the servants of God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">But God
be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from
the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. Being then
made fm from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness (6:17-18). We
were once the servants of sin, but now we're the servants of God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">I speak,
Paul said, after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your
flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and
to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to
righteousness unto holiness (6:19).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Again, we
face the choice. We must make a willful and deliberate decision not to
conform to this world but rather to yield to the Spirit of God. We must
reckon the old man to be dead. Christ has set us free. That freedom
marks the difference between us and the world. The unbeliever yields to
the flesh, because he has no choice. He's under sin's power and has no
control over it. Many sinners hate their sins and would like to be set
free. Some of them even go to clinics for help. Though their sins gave
pleasure for a time, these sins are now ruling and destroying their
lives. In contrast, the Christian has been set free from the bondage of
corruption. He has come to Jesus Christ in faith and yielded his body
as an instrument of God to be controlled by His Spirit.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For when
ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. What
fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the
end of those things is death (6:20-21). The way of the flesh is the
path of death.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">But now
being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your
fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. For the wages of sin
is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our
Lord (6:22-23). In a later chapter Paul asks, "What shall we then say
to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?" (Romans
8:31). What "things"? The blessings of eternal life in Christ, God's
glorious gift, spoken of here in Chapter 6.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul also
said, "Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of
ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God" (II Corinthians 3:5). God's
work in my life is sufficient to bring me to victory. Whenever the
flesh rises up and seeks to draw me away, I reckon the old man to be
dead, yield my body to God in faith, and receive victory.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Death,
sin, and the flesh are always related. To live after the flesh is to
miss God's mark for your life. Even so, spirit, righteousness, and life
are related. The right God-ordained order for your life is to live
after the spirit.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">God is a
superior Trinity of Father, Son, and Spirit. Man is an inferior trinity
of spirit, soul (mind), and body (flesh). If a man's spirit is alive
and uppermost, he has fellowship with God. If a man's flesh is
uppermost, his fellowship with God is broken, because God wants nothing
to do with his sinful flesh. Man can only meet God in the spirit. "God
is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and
in truth" (John 4:24). "The Spirit itself beareth witness with our
spirit" (Romans 8:16).

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Here in
Chapter 7 we see Paul's agony over trying to personally apply the
truths of the previous chapters. A man may know the truth, but its
application can cause intense problems.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul
addresses the opening verses to Jewish believers, not to the general
body of Gentile believers. Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them
that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long
as he liveth? (7:1). The point here is that the Mosaic Law held power
over a Jew as long as he lived.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For the
woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long
as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of
her husband. So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to
another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be
dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though
she be married to another man. Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are
become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married
to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should
bring forth fruit unto God (7:24).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">A married
woman was bound to her husband as long as he lived or until he divorced
her. (In Judaism a woman had no right to divorce her husband. The
bride's father would demand a substantial dowry before the marriage to
support the woman in case the husband put her away. This was actually
alimony in advance.)
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Gentiles
have never been under the Mosaic Law. Even the early Church fathers
decided not to impose the bondage of the Law upon the Gentile
believers, since they weren't able to bear it themselves (Acts
15:13-24).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul is
showing the Jewish believers that death brought freedom from the Law
and as Christians they had died with Christ. Therefore, the Jewish
believers were set free from the Law. They had been freed from the Old
Covenant by death and joined to the New Covenant through Jesus Christ.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For when
we were in the flesh, the motions [passions] of sins, which were by the
law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. But now
we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held;
that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of
the letter (7:5-6). The Law worked in a man's body to bring forth fruit
leading to death. Now he has been delivered from the Law and a New
Covenant has been established. The Law was never intended to make a man
righteous, for if righteousness could come by the Law then Christ died
in vain (Galatians 2:21). God gave the Law to show man his sin and to
condemn him. It exposes the guilt of the whole world by revealing man's
failure to meet God's standards.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul goes
on to tell us, What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay,
I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust I was a
sinner, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. But sin, taking
occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence.
For without the law sin was dead (7:7-8). In a tragic misinterpretation
of the Law, the Jews had tried to keep it as their claim to
righteousness. This error persists in Judaism to this day. The modern
Jew tries to outweigh his evil deeds with good ones. Yom Kippur, the
Day of Atonement, is now a day to reflect over his past actions.
However, there's no sacrifice to cover or put away his sin and guilt.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The Law
isn't sin, but it certainly brings a man to the awareness of sin. Paul
said that he didn't know what sin was until the Law revealed it to him,
for without the Law sin was dead.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For I was
alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived,
and I died. And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to
be unto death. For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived
me, and by it slew me. Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment
holy, and just, and good. Was then that which is good made death unto
me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me
by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become
exceeding sinful. For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am
carnal, sold under sin (7:9-14).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The
problem is me. I agree that I should obey the Law. I should love the
Lord my God with all my heart, soul, mind, and strength. I should love
my neighbor as myself and shouldn't break any of the commandments. The
Law is good, right, and just. But with the Law comes the consciousness
of God's requirement, and I become aware of how far short I have
fallen.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul
said, "The law is spiritual" (7:14a). By interpreting the Law in a
physical sense, the Pharisees believed that they had attained
righteousness. As a Pharisee, Paul was blameless in keeping the Law's
outward observances. However, when he came to the realization that the
Law was spiritual, he stood condemned. He had violated the spirit of
the Law many times. The Law, intended to govern the attitudes of men,
showed that all were guilty before God. "There is none righteous, no,
not one" (Romans 3:10).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Now we
need help! The Law brings us to a point of despair and hopelessness. It
forces us to look for help beyond ourselves. Any religious system
teaching that help can be found within us is bound to fail. Our nature
is sinful, in rebellion to God, and not subject to His will. The
weakness of the Law isn't in the Law. It is in us.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The first
covenant that God established with man was based on rules "which if a
man do, he shall live in them" (Leviticus 18:5b). However, man was so
sinful that this Old Covenant broke down. So, God established a second
covenant with man, the New Covenant based not on keeping rules but on
believing in His Son.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Jesus
took upon Himself all your guilt and died in your place. For believing
in Him, God credits you with the righteousness of Christ. This New
Covenant differs diametrically from the old one. The Law depended upon
man's faithfulness, and it failed because man was unfaithful. The New
Covenant depends upon God's faithfulness, and it stands because God is
totally faithful. So, you stand by the grace of God!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For we
know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin. For
that which I do I allow [know] not: for what I would, that do I not;
but what I hate, that do I (7:14-15). When Paul first realized that the
Law was spiritual, he began trying to fulfill the spirit of the Law in
his own strength.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Many
Christians still try to establish a legal relationship with God. I
struggled with this problem for years, because I grew up in a "holiness
church". We were always pledging to do good works for God. We'd never
smoke, drink, or go to the movies. Our rules weren't the Ten
Commandments as such, but regulations set up by our church leaders
emphasizing a legal relationship with God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">However,
God doesn't want a legal relationship with us. He wants a love
relationship. Legal contracts are impersonal and formal, but God wants
a love that cannot come by the Law. Paul discovered this truth when he
came to the knowledge of Jesus Christ, but he still struggled with his
instincts from the old experience. He said, "The things that I really
want to do, I don't do; and the things that I don't want to do, I do.
And I hate it!"
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">If then I
do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good. Now
then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me (7:16-17).
The desire to sin isn't the new me, it's my old sinful nature. "For the
flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and
these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the
things that ye would" (Galatians 5:17). The non-Christian lives after
his flesh and has no conflict with it. The Christian's desires have
changed, but he's still in his body of flesh. He wants to please God in
his flesh and tries to conform it to the will of God. However, he finds
himself doing things that he doesn't want to do.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">How many
times had I promised God, "I'm going to read ten chapters of the Bible
and pray one hour every day this week." Yet I didn't do it. I found
myself breaking vows and promises to God, because the good that I
wanted to do I couldn't do.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Now then
it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. For I know
that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will
is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not
(7:17-18). It has taken me many years to come to this truth, and I'm
not sure that I completely live by it yet. Sometimes I think that
there's some good within me, but more and more I agree with Paul: "in
my flesh dwells no good thing. "
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">God
passes only one sentence upon our flesh: death. He doesn't remodel the
"old man," because the old nature is beyond repair. God has condemned
the life of the flesh to death on the Cross.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The will
to do good is present within me, but that's not the problem. The
problem is my performance. Remember Jesus' words when He came to Peter
and found him sleeping: "Could you not watch with me one hour?... The
spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak" (Matthew 26:40b,41b).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For the
good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.
Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that
dwelleth in me. I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is
present with me. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man
(7:19-22). Inwardly I consent to obey the Law of God and delight in it.
"Lord, I want communion and fellowship with You. I want to be Yours
completely."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">But I see
another law in my members [body], warring against the law of my mind,
and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members
(7:23). This is real spiritual conflict. "For we wrestle not against
flesh and blood, but against principalities," against those strong
forces working within our flesh (Ephesians 6:12a).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">O
wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this
death? (7:24). You struggle, you try to overcome, you fight against the
lusts of the flesh. But you're not making any progress!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">As a
possible example, let's say that you're overweight. You try every diet
that exists. You admit that dieting is good. "I want to get rid of
these extra twenty pounds. I'm not going to eat any more hot fudge
sundaes." But by next Saturday you can't resist. "The good that I would
I do not" (7:19). This body of flesh is still in opposition to your own
will, continuing to bring areas of your life into captivity. If this
wasn't the case, you would weigh twenty pounds less.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">All
Christians experience the battle of flesh against spirit. We're chained
to a dead man, and wherever we go we drag this old carcass with us.
It's smelly, corrupt, and we hate it, yet we're bound to it. In the
next chapter of Romans Paul says that we "groan within ourselves,
waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body" (Romans
8:23b). Oh, how we long to live in a redeemed body! Then we won't have
this struggle anymore.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">At this
point in his walk Paul was struggling with the desires of the body. He
found that his flesh brought him into captivity, and he was acting in
ways that he didn't want to. There was great conflict between his will
and actions, between his spirit and flesh. In desperation he finally
cried out, "Who shall deliver me?" When we cry out like this, help is
near.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The
highly effective Alcoholics Anonymous program recognizes and teaches
this principle. First, the member must recognize that he has a problem.
Second, he must seek help beyond himself. This is the key for real
deliverance.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">I'm
living in this body of the flesh which has a tremendous influence on
me. However, I can't overcome its power by myself. "Who shall deliver
me?" By reaching out and taking hold of God, I begin to experience the
overcoming power of His Spirit. Now I find that God can do what I can't
do for myself.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">As long
as you're trying to deliver yourself, the Christian life will be one
frustration and defeat after another. With the mind I myself serve the
law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin (7:25b). You want to do
good and serve God, yet you're overcome by the impulses and desires of
the flesh. As long as you're striving on your own, you'll find yourself
living in the anguish described in Chapter 7 of Romans.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">In
despair I cry out for help. "Who shall deliver me from the body of this
death?" Paul said, I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord (7:25a).
Must I forever struggle, fight, and be defeated by my flesh? No.
Through Jesus Christ our Lord, God has given me a way out. I don't have
to be overcome by my fleshly nature anymore, for in Him I find true
deliverance.

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">In Chapter
8 Paul explains how God looks upon the mind and heart of the Christian
who desires to serve and follow after Him. God sees his faith in Jesus
Christ, and There is therefore now no condemnation to them who are in
Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For
the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from
the law of sin and death (8:1-2).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For years
mankind was under the law of sin and death. When we would want to do
good, evil was present. We were bound by sin and death just as we're
bound by the law of gravity. It was holding us earthbound or, more
accurately, flesh-bound.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">However,
the law of gravity can be overcome by the proper application of certain
natural laws, such as the principle of aerodynamics. Though
aerodynamics doesn't negate gravity, it can overcome its force.
Likewise, the application of certain spiritual laws can overcome the
law of sin and death.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">I'm no
longer condemned by the Law of Moses, because the new law of faith
operates in my life. I enter this new relationship with God through
Jesus Christ and experience the life of Christ, which sets me free from
the old Law. This new law of faith in Christ overcomes the effects of
the old Law of condemnation.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For what
the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God
sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin,
condemned sin in the flesh (8:3). The Mosaic Law couldn't make me
righteous, because my sinful nature prevented true obedience.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">In
contrast, this new law of life makes me righteous before God. That the
righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, not by us (8:4a). I
no longer try to attain my righteousness by observing the Law of Moses.
The Law and its righteousness is fulfilled in me, because Jesus Christ
has fulfilled it for me.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Who walk
not after the flesh, but after the Spirit (8:4b). The requirements for
fulfilling the righteousness of the Law are met by living according to
the Spirit and not walking after the flesh.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For they
that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that
are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally
minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace
(8:5-6). Since I'm walking after the Spirit, I now live according to
the things of the Spirit. With this spiritual-mindedness I have life
and peace.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The two
main parts of man's nature are flesh and spirit. He also possesses a
consciousness, his mind, which is controlled by either his body or
spirit. If he walks after the flesh, his mind is controlled by the
flesh; if he walks after the Spirit, it's controlled by the Spirit.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">When God
created Adam, He formed the body from the dust of the earth. At first
Adam's body had no life. Then God breathed into that figure "and man
became a living soul" (Genesis 2:7c), a trinity of spirit, mind, and
body.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Because
God's breath was in him, man became a spiritual creature with a
consciousness governed by God. Since Adam had the mind of the Spirit,
he walked and communed with God in the Garden of Eden. Though he had
his bodily appetites, he wasn't ruled by them. When he disobeyed God
and obeyed the lust of his flesh by eating the forbidden fruit, his
nature was turned around. Its order became body, soul, and spirit. The
flesh took control of his mind, and he lost the consciousness of
fellowship with God. Coming to the Garden to commune with him, God
cried, "Adam, where are you?" Adam was hiding because he had alienated
himself from God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Even
today, every man dominated by his body is alienated from God and the
life of God. The mind of the flesh is death (8:6), and such a mind has
no awareness of the presence or love of God. It is dead to God and the
things of the Spirit.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Jesus
said, "Whatever is born of flesh is flesh. To be born of the Spirit,
you must be born again" (John 3:3, 6). When I'm born again, the old
things pass away and all things become new. Conversion takes place by
the Spirit of God, and I become as new as when God created Adam.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The order
of my nature is now spirit, soul, and body, the order that God intended
for man. I begin to have the mind of the Spirit, which is life. The
awareness of God's presence pervades my life and I desire more of Him
and the things of God. Peace with God, peace within myself, and peace
with my brothers now fills me, because God has brought me back to life.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For they
that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh (8:5a). Jesus
described the people of the world as always concerned with eating,
drinking, and clothing themselves. "What shall we eat? What shall we
drink? What shall we wear?" (Matthew 6:31).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">But they
that are after the Spirit do mind [have their minds set on] the things
of the Spirit (8:5b). Those who are born again are absorbed with the
ways of God, His love, and His Word. They seek Him first.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For to be
carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and
peace. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are
in the flesh cannot please God (8:6-8). The carnal mind brings death,
because it's in a losing war with God. The mind of the flesh doesn't
yield to God's Law, since it's in rebellion. Thus it cannot please God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">But ye
are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of
God dwells in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is
none of his. And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin;
but the Spirit is life because of righteousness (8:9-10). We find the
delivering power of the Spirit through the indwelling of Jesus Christ.
What we cannot do for ourselves He does for us.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Bob
Munger wrote a wonderful booklet, "My Heart Christ's Home" (Inter
Varsity Press, 1954). In it he describes a Christian who invites Christ
to come in, settle down, and make Himself at home in his heart. The day
this fellow invited Christ into his heart was glorious. Every morning
the Lord and he would rise early, sit together, plan the day, and talk
in beautiful, warm fellowship. As the days went by, the Christian
gradually began getting up too late to enjoy this fellowship. Seeing
Jesus sitting and waiting for him, he'd say, "Lord, I'm in a hurry
today. But I'll be back tomorrow." Then he'd rush out the door.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">After
many days passed, the man longed for real fellowship with the Lord.
Early one morning he stopped by, sat down, and said, "Oh, Lord, I've
missed this!" He was surprised to hear Him say, "I've missed it, too."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">One day
the Christian came home from work and the Lord said, "There's a
horrible smell in this house. I located it in the closet upstairs, but
the closet door is locked."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The man
said, "I've given You the whole house. All I've kept for myself is that
little closet upstairs. Why can't You just ignore it?"
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">"I can't live in the same house with that smell," Jesus said. "Either it goes or I go."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The man softened. "Actually, I've tried to clean that up for a long time, but I don't think I can, Lord."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The Lord said, "Will you give me the permission to clean it up for you? Just give me the key, and I'll take care of it."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The man
reluctantly handed over the key. The Lord went to work. He cleaned and
scrubbed until He got rid of the stink and filth in that closet. Though
the Christian was unable to do the job himself, he discovered that the
Lord would do it, if only he would yield. After the work was done,
fellowship between the two was better than ever.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Maybe you
have a locked closet in your heart. The Lord is saying, "This area of
the flesh that you still serve must go." Simply give Him the key. He'll
do a terrific job of cleaning the mess in that old, smelly closet.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">And if
Christ be in you, the body [old nature] is dead because of sin; but the
Spirit is life because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of him that
raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ
from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that
dwelleth in you (8:1-11). As Jesus was raised from the dead by the
power of the Holy Spirit, we also are made alive by the Holy Spirit. We
have a new life, the resurrected life of Christ.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">As a
Christian, I need to recognize that my old nature was crucified. I'm
now living according to my new nature and walking after the Spirit.
With the Spirit of God dwelling in me, I'm not following after the
flesh but after the Spirit.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Therefore,
brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh
(8:12). I don't owe my old nature anything, because I've been freed
from that bondage.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For if ye
live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do
mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live (8:13). Who will deliver
me from the deeds of the body? God has provided the plan of victory
through the Holy Spirit. The disciples were promised, "You will receive
power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you" (Acts 1:8). He gives us the
power to live as He wants us to live, freeing us from the bondage of
the flesh.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For as
many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God (8:14).
Many people claim to be children of God; but it's not what they claim
that counts, it's what they are (see I John 4:20-21). Do they follow
the Spirit of God, or do they live without seeking His will?
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For ye
have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have
received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The
Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children
of God (8:15-16). Abba is Aramaic for "father." I've been adopted by
God into His family, and His Spirit bears witness with mine that I'm
His son. So, it's only natural for me to cry, "Father! Father!"
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">And if
children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ
(8:17a). God has given Christ everything because He is the Son.
Becoming a child of God through Jesus Christ makes me a joint-heir of
all things with Him. Jesus said, "Then shall the King say unto them on
his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
prepared for you from the foundation of the world" (Matthew 25:34). As
a child of God, all the Father owns belongs to me, potentially.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">If so be
that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together
(8:17b). When Moses came of age, the Egyptian throne was his for the
taking. He chose "to suffer affliction with the people of God, [rather]
than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming the reproach
of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had
respect unto the recompense of the reward" (Hebrews 11:25-26).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Moses
could have been the Pharaoh of Egypt, spending all the years of this
life in pomp and glory; or he could choose to suffer with the children
of God on earth and spend eternity in the glory of God's kingdom. Moses
made a wise decision. He chose the worst that the Lord had to offer,
the reproach of Christ, rather than the best the world had to offer,
the kingdom of man. If you were to ask him about it today, he'd say, "I
made the right choice. For the past 3800 years I've been enjoying its
benefits. I have no regrets!"
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For
enduring the reproach of Christ we'll be glorified together. For I
reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be
compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us (8:18). Paul
wrote to the Corinthians, "Our light affliction, which is but for a
moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of
glory" (II Corinthians 4:17). Notice the contrast between "light
affliction" and "eternal weight," affliction for a "moment" and
"eternal glory." Our present sufferings aren't worth comparing with the
glory to be revealed.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For the
earnest expectation of the creature [creation] waiteth for the
manifestation of the sons of God (8:19). Certain egotistic Christians
apply this Scripture to their own fellowships, claiming that the world
is waiting for their manifestation. I can understand their
self-centered feelings. When I graduated from seminary I thought the
world was waiting for me, too. After years in school, I was thrilled to
get my diploma, receive my assignment, and head out to save the world.
I was shocked. Nobody was waiting for me. I had to bribe people to
attend church by giving them lollipops. The fact is that the world
isn't waiting for any group to be manifested. Besides, Paul isn't
talking about such a manifestation here.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul
explains the meaning. For the creature [referring to us] was made
subject to vanity [emptiness], not willingly, but by reason of him who
hath subjected the same in hope (8:20). For His own reasons God created
man with an emptiness. This spiritual void causes man to seek after
God, to find Him, and to fellowship with Him. Tragically, man often
tries to fill that spiritual void with the things of this world.
However, his physical and emotional experiences only lead to a greater
sense of emptiness.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">As man
exists on the three levels of body, soul, and spirit, so his needs
create drives on these three levels. We're all too familiar with our
bodily drives, such as air, thirst, hunger, bowel and bladder or sex.
We also recognize our soulish drives for security, love, the need to be
needed, etc. What man so often tries to ignore is the crying need in
his spirit for a meaningful relationship with God. As the psalmist
David said, "My soul longs after thee, O God" (Psalm 84:2).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">As long
as you're trying to fill that spiritual void in your life with the
things of this world, you'll find that the inner cry for God goes on.
The moment you invite Jesus Christ to come and dwell in your spirit,
you'll begin to experience the fullness that God desires you to know
through Him.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Because
the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of
corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we
know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together
until now. And not only they [the world around us], but ourselves also,
which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan
within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of
our body (8:21-23).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul
speaks of bringing the creation into the glorious freedom of the
children of God. This doesn't mean that Christians will be manifested
as sons of God taking over earthly governments and ushering in God's
kingdom of righteousness and peace. Paul is saying that God will
exchange my old body for a new one, and I'll be with Him when He
returns in power and glory to establish the kingdom of God on earth.
I'm waiting for a new body to be in perfect harmony with my redeemed
spirit. Then the war against my flesh will finally be over. Oh, how I
long for that day!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">In I
Corinthians 15:51 Paul speaks of a new revelation from God: we will not
all sleep as in death, but "we shall all be changed" in a moment. This
corruptible body will be changed into an incorruptible one; this mortal
body will be exchanged for an immortal one. The greatest problems in my
Christian life have come from the weakness of my flesh. Once I
experience that glorious metamorphosis, my problems will be over. Even
so, come quickly, Lord Jesus.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For we
are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man
seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not,
then do we with patience wait for it (8:24-25). If this body of flesh
was already perfected and free of all worldly lusts, why would I hope
for deliverance? My hope is in God's promise of His future work.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">As long
as I'm in this body, I'll be subject to its imperfections; but there's
no condemnation against me, because I'm walking after the Spirit. I
love Christ, and so God doesn't impute my unrighteousness to me. He has
accounted me righteous, because with my mind I'm serving the law of the
Spirit, even though with my flesh I'm still stumbled and sometimes
fall. My failures are painful to me just as they're painful to Him.
Thank God that my anxiety will one day be over. Paul says that while
we're locked in this body "we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed
upon with our house which is from heaven that mortality might be
swallowed up by life" (II Corinthians 5:2,4b). Until the reality of
that day, I hope and wait patiently for God to complete His work.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Likewise
the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should
pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us
with groanings which cannot be uttered (8:26). One weakness of this
body is a lack of knowledge about God's will in every situation. Since
the purpose of prayer is to open the doors for God's will to be done,
how can I pray when I don't know His will? The Spirit helps me to
overcome my ignorance.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Suppose
that God is freeing a Christian from his old, natural ways through a
series of trials. Seeing the man suffering, I pray, "Lord, deliver him
from his trials." However, the worst thing in the world for that man
would be deliverance from his trials before the work of God was
completed. So, I could be praying in opposition to the will of God in
my brother's life.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Enter the
Spirit, who "maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be
uttered." To God the deep, wordless utterances of heartfelt prayer
aren't unintelligible sounds, but powerful supplications. God
understands them completely, for the Spirit within the believer prays
according to the will of God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Such
divine intercession can seemingly insult my intelligence. After all, I
want to understand the situation, but these unintelligible groanings
affront my natural understanding. However, by faith I pray in the
Spirit. For we're told, He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is
the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints
according to the will of God (8:27). The Spirit intercedes according to
God's will, for God knows "what is the mind of the Spirit." Surely we
should talk less and "groan" more!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">And we
know that all things work together for good (8:28a). A variation of
this Scripture has become popular in many Christian circles: "We know
that some things work together for good." They think that God has a
purpose for some things, but not all things. "Why did God allow me to
go through that difficult experience? What possible good can come from
that?" Yet God's Word remains true and unchanging.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For whom
do all things work together for good? For every man and woman on the
street? No. To them that love God, to them who are the called according
to his purpose (8:28b). Only a child of God can have this wonderful
assurance.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Romans
8:28 has sustained me through some of the most difficult experiences of
my life. When everything comes apart and I don't understand the events
around me, I fall back on this verse. "All things work together for
good..." God has a good purpose for everything I experience, because I
love Him and He has called me according to His plan. This gives me
peace in chaotic circumstances and strength in the hour of great
testing. How this buoys me up when my intellect is exhausted from
struggling to understand. What blessed assurance for the saints of God!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For whom
he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image
of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren (8:29).
A subject such as predestination can create quite a problem within the
Church. The difficulty usually arises from pressing a truth of God to a
seemingly logical conclusion.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The
problem about predestination can be stated like this: "If God has
already predestined those who are saved, then He must have also
predestined those who are lost. In that case, why should we do anything
to save the lost? Those predestined to be saved surely will be saved.
And there's nothing we can do about those who are predestined to be
lost. So, why worry about it? Why witness? Why support missionaries?
Why pray?" See how far astray human reasoning can go on a simple truth
of God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">You must
have all the facts about a case in order to make a reasoned judgment,
but you don't and can't know all the facts about predestination. "For
whom he did foreknow" Do you have foreknowledge?
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">God knew
in advance who would respond to His love and grace, and these He
predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son. The example of a
football game rerun might be helpful in understanding this concept. If
you saw the game in person, you already know what happened. You won't
get excited watching the rerun on TV, even in the tension-packed
closing minutes. You know which team won.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">In the
Psalms Moses declared that our lives are spent as a tale that is told
(Psalm 90:9b). From God's point of view our lives are like a rerun. He
knows in advance every decision, response, and reaction we'll make. So,
I don't understand God's predestination because I don't look at life as
He does. I don't know the end from the beginning, for I only "see
through a glass darkly" (I Corinthians 13:12).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The
difficulty lies in trying to understand how an omnipotent God makes His
choices. I hear people say that His choices aren't fair. But what do
they know about it? Nothing! The ways of the Lord are beyond man's
understanding, and His mind is far beyond man's ability to comprehend
(Romans 11:34).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Of course
I believe in predestination, since it's plainly taught in the
Scriptures. The doctrine could be assumed, even if the word was never
explicitly used. It's a thrilling truth that doesn't upset me at all.
The fact that He chose me and began a good work in me proves that He'll
continue to perform it. He wouldn't bring me this far and then dump me.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">When did
God choose me? When I surrendered my life to Jesus? No. When I decided
to serve Him? No. When He saw that He could do some work in me? No. God
chose me before He ever formed the foundations of this world (Ephesians
1:4). He established the glorious plan for my life millenniums ago. My
future with Him is as good as accomplished, because He knows it'll be
worked out perfectly.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Moreover
whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them
he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified
(8:30). This verse takes me from the past to the future, showing God's
complete work of predestination, calling, justification, and
glorification. Although my glorification is yet to come, God speaks of
it as past history. What glorious assurance is mine in Christ Jesus.
God - who speaks of things before they are as though they were, because
He knows all things and knows they shall be, and as far as He is
concerned they are already - has spoken of my glorification. It's as
certain as His Word.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">What shall we then say to these things? (8:31a). I say, "Hallelujah!" I love the wonderful truth of what God has done for me.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">If God be
for us, who can be against us? (8:31b). God is for you. He's planned
your journey through life from the beginning of the ages, and now He's
working it out before your eyes.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">During
the early years of my Christian experience, I thought that God was
against me. I imagined that He was making a list and checking it twice,
and He would punish me because I hadn't been very nice. God was waiting
for me to make a mistake, so He could order me out of the game. I was
terrified. O what joy I found when I learned that God was for me! I
rejoice because He has made all the powers of heaven to strengthen and
sustain me, not to destroy me. The powers of God are working for me,
and they're much greater and stronger than the powers that are working
against me.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">If God is
for me, who can be against me? Satan can, but who is he to God? He
isn't on an equal level with God. We sometimes think of him as God's
opposite, but he isn't. As a created being Satan cannot be compared to
God in any area. The vast disparity between the finite and the infinite
defies comparison. More like the demonic equivalent of an archangel,
Satan might give Michael or Gabriel a bad time (Daniel 10:13-14), but
he's no match for God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Who can
be against me? The world, the flesh, and the devil are against me. But
these are no match for God who helps me, strengthens me, and works to
present me faultless before His glorious presence with great joy (Jude
24).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">He that
spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he
not with him also freely give us all things? (8:32). Here Paul
encourages us by moving from the greater to the lesser. What do you
need from God? "Lord, my needs are so many. How will You ever supply
them?" For starters, look what He's already given you. The things that
you presently need are nothing by comparison. He loves you so much that
He spared not His own Son. You were redeemed not with perishable things
such as silver and gold from the empty life you used to lead, but with
the precious blood of Jesus Christ, who was slain as a lamb without
spot or blemish (I Peter 1:18-19).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Who shall
lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth
(8:33). Is God charging me with sin? No. "Blessed is the man to whom
the Lord does not impute sin" (Psalm 32:2). However, Satan accuses me
day and night. He charges me with failure, incompetence, and countless
horrible offenses. Yet God has justified me, and He cannot accuse me
and justify me at the same time. So why should I worry?
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Who is he
that condemneth? (8:34a). Not God. The Holy Spirit may be convicting me
of sin, but He isn't condemning me. Condemnation is the work of Satan.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">What's
the difference between the condemnation of Satan and the conviction of
the Holy Spirit? When Satan condemns me, I want to run from God.
"You've failed God so miserably and completely!" Satan says. "You have
no right to ask for His help. He's tired of you and your failures. Why
don't you do Him a favor and drop dead?" I often find myself agreeing
with Satan and becoming alienated from God. His condemnation drives me
from God. Whenever I think, "I shouldn't approach God because of what
I've done," Satan is condemning me.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">When the
Spirit convicts me, I can't wait to come to God. The Spirit of God
deals with me by drawing me to Him. "Lord, I want to confess this sin!"
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">"Who is
he that condemneth?" Satan condemns me, people often condemn me, and I
condemn myself; but none of these count. Jesus is the one who counts,
and He is far from condemning me. He intercedes on my behalf.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">It is
Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the
right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us (8:34b). Jesus
stands before God and says, "Father, there's Chuck. Forgive him for My
sake. I paid for all his sins." Jesus never says, "Father, I'm tired of
Chuck! Why don't we just shove him out?" Jesus is interceding for me,
not condemning me.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul now
bursts forth with a glorious statement. Who shall separate us from the
love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or
famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, For thy
sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the
slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through
him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life,
nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor
things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be
able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our
Lord (8:35-39). I'm tied in so tightly to God that nothing can remove
me from His love.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!
<br>Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine!
<br>Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
<br>Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.
<br>This is my story, this is my song,
<br>Praising my Savior all the day long. [1]
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">God loved
me before the foundation of the world. He loved me when I was a wretch
who hated Him and rebelled against Him. How much more does He love me
now that I'm fumbling, struggling, and seeking to do my best to serve
Him. Now my heart is open to Him, my desires are toward Him, and I love
Him and want to serve Him. How much more will He sustain me through my
weaknesses, strengthen me in my desperate hour, draw me daily to
Himself, and grant me His victory within my life. The principalities
and powers of darkness cannot overthrow me, because I'm more than a
conqueror through Him that loves me. I belong to Jesus now and forever.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">I'm sure
of my relationship with God and my eternal life in Him. I have nothing
to fear or to worry about. I simply cling to my Lord Jesus Christ. He
has loved me and I love Him because of His love. He has filled me with
His Spirit, given me His power, and strengthened me day by day. Glory
to God forever and ever!

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">At this
point in his letter Paul explains that God has removed the national
privileges and blessings from Israel. The Jews had enjoyed a
most-favored-nation status with God. However, by rejecting the
righteousness provided for them through Jesus the Messiah, the "natural
branch" of Israel has been cut off for a time.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">In
matters of salvation, Israel no longer retains a privileged status. Jew
and Gentile alike must come to Jesus, for He is God's answer for every
man's sin. "All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; being
justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ
Jesus" (Romans 3:23-24).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">As he
speaks of Israel's severance from its divine privileges, Paul realizes
that many will accuse him of bitterness against the Jews because they
rejected him. Lest he be charged with contempt toward his own race, he
begins by affirming his love for the Jews, a love as strong as Moses'.
"Please forgive their sin," Moses interceded after Israel had made the
golden calf. "And if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which
thou hast written" (Exodus 32:32). Like Moses, Paul was willing to give
up his own salvation for the sake of his fellow Jews, and with this
deep concern he begins his discussion of Israel.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">I say the
truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in
the Holy Ghost, that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my
heart. For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my
brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh: who are Israelites
(9:1-4a).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul's
great burden for the Jews weighs heavily upon his heart. He grieves
that they're neglecting the righteousness provided by God in Jesus
Christ. He grieves, too, that his brothers by heritage have now been
cut off from God's fellowship and denied the blessings and favors which
were once upon them. He describes these blessings: to whom pertaineth
the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the
law, and the service of God, and the promises (9:4b). Let's look at
these more closely.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">First,
the Jews had been adopted by God as His own people, because Abraham
believed by faith that God would do as He promised. "I will make of
thee a great nation" (Genesis 12:2a). God made a nation from Abraham
through which the Messiah came. He watched over, cared for, and
nurtured the children of Abraham as His own. God's adoption of the Jews
eventually included the Gentiles. In thee [Abraham] shall all families
of the earth be blessed" (Genesis 12:3b).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Second,
the glory of God rested upon Israel. When the Jews left Egypt, the
glory of God went with them in the form of a cloud by day and a pillar
of fire by night (Exodus 13:22). The consciousness of His presence was
constantly with Israel. In the wilderness the glory of God filled the
Holy of Holies in the tabernacle (Exodus 29:43), and He dwelt in the
midst of His people. The glory of God descended on their place of
worship when Solomon built the temple in Jerusalem (I Kings 8:10-11).
The glory of God's presence was their privilege.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Third,
God had made a covenant with Abraham. He then established that covenant
with the nation through the Law of Moses. He would be their God through
the giving of the Law, and they would be His people through their
service to Him.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Finally,
God had made promises to this nation, promises that are still valid.
Today, we see the Lord fulfilling His word to His people. He said He
would bring the Jews back into their land from all nations (Ezekiel
34:13,36:24). As the whole world knows, the Jews are back in their
land. God promised, "Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of
the world with fruit" (Isaiah 27:6). Israel is the world's third
largest exporter of fruit and does indeed "fill the face of the world
with fruit." Exporting flowers is also a major Israeli industry. The
country continues to literally "blossom and bud" as God fulfills His
word.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul goes
on to say that to Israel belong the fathers [patriarchs] and of whom as
concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed forever.
Amen (9:5).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">There
have been several poor translations of this verse by scholars who deny
the deity of Jesus Christ. In fact, the Revised Standard Version (RSV)
handles the translation so blasphemously that it cannot even be
considered an accurate rendering. In Greek verse five reads, "...as
concerning the flesh Christ came, who is God over all, blessed
forever." Here Paul plainly declares that Christ is God over all. The
RSV turns this verse into a doxology, and so removes the force of
Paul's declaration of Christ's deity: "...according to the flesh, is
the Christ. God who is over all be blessed forever." This
interpretation changes the meaning of the text. Paul affirms Christ's
deity throughout his Epistles, and this verse is one of his strongest
and clearest affirmations.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Not as
though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all
Israel, which are of Israel (9:6). Not all the descendants of Jacob are
truly of Israel. To find out what Paul means, let's look at the story
of Jacob in the Old Testament.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Jacob and
Esau, the sons of Isaac, were twins, Esau being born first. He looked
like a hairy, red garment, so his parents named him Hairy, in Hebrew
"Esau." Jacob grabbed his brother's heel during birth, so they named
him Heel-catcher, which is "Jacob" in Hebrew (a name that came to mean
"deceiver" or "supplanter").
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">As the
oldest son, Esau stood to inherit the birthright. One day, Jacob took
advantage of his brother's great hunger and traded Esau a mess of
pottage for the birthright. Later, when their father Isaac was to place
the family blessing on Esau, Jacob tricked his old, blind father and
received the blessing intended for his brother. When Esau discovered
that Jacob had cheated him out of his blessing, he threatened to kill
him. Afraid, Jacob fled to his uncle who lived far away.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">After
many years, Jacob decided to return home. He had only traveled partway
when he received news that Esau was coming to him with a large company
of men. Fear gripped Jacob's heart and he really prayed!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">That
night an angel of the Lord wrestled with Jacob. When the angel saw that
he couldn't prevail against Jacob, he touched his hip and it slipped
out of joint. In this crippled condition Jacob cried, "I won't let you
go until you bless me!"
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">"What is your name?" the angel asked.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">"Heel-catcher," said Jacob.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The angel
replied, "Your name will no longer be Heel-catcher, but Israel"
(Genesis 32:2-28). Jacob's new name meant "governed by God." Paul said,
"For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel." In other words, not
all the descendants of Jacob are governed by God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">In
biblical times most names had significance, because the people related
them to the personal characteristics of the individual. Paul tells us
that no one is truly Israel unless he is governed by God. We have a
parallel situation with the word "Christian." Not everyone who is
called a Christian is truly a follower of Christ.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Neither,
because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In
Isaac shall thy seed be called (9:7). Ishmael, a son of Abraham who
became the father of the Arabs, didn't inherit the promises. So, not
all of the descendants of Abraham are God's chosen people.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">God
promised Abraham a son through Sarah. "I will bless her, and give thee
a son also of her" (Genesis 17:16a). However, Abraham wanted God to
accept the work of his flesh with Ishmael, so he said, "O that Ishmael
might live before thee!" (Genesis 17:18). But God refused to honor
Abraham's request.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Ishmael
represents the man of the flesh and Isaac the man of the spirit.
Ishmael, the result of Abraham's attempt to help God, wasn't
recognized, because God doesn't recognize the works of our flesh. God
told Abraham, "Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac" (Genesis 22:2a).
God didn't even acknowledge Ishmael as Abraham's son.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">How often
we serve God in the energies of our flesh. Many ministers try building
their churches through publicity campaigns, promotions, and financial
analysis. They're using the efforts of the flesh to promote God's work.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For
example, let's say that we wanted to raise a million dollars for our
church. For a ten percent commission, professionals specializing in
fund-raising drives for churches will raise the money for us,
guaranteed. Many churches use such services.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">This is
just one tragic testimony of the Church's failure to walk in the
Spirit. Following the ways of the world, she tries to do the work of
God. But God doesn't want works in the energies and power of the flesh
offered to Him. He refuses them. The Church's only hope of survival is
to be led and energized by the Spirit of God. The Church is too big to
push with the flesh, and unless the Spirit of God keeps working, she's
finished.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">God's
promises to Abraham greatly affect today's Mideast situation. When
Abraham first settled in the land, God said, "Lift up now thine eyes,
and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and
eastward, and westward: for all the land which thou seest, to thee will
I give it, and to thy seed forever" (Genesis 13:14-15). This promise
wasn't made to Ishmael and his descendants, the Arabs. It was made to
the chosen heir, Isaac, and his descendants, the Jews.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">That is,
They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of
God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed. For this
is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have
a son. And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one,
even by our father Isaac; (for the children being not yet born, neither
having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to
election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;) it was
said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger (9:8-12).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">As God
made a distinction between Isaac and Ishmael, the sons of Abraham, so
He distinguished between Jacob and Esau, the sons of Isaac. Jacob was
accepted, and through him the promises and the Messiah came. Esau was
rejected, and prophecies speak of his descendants being cut off as a
nation (Genesis 36:9 with Obadiah 9-10).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">As it is
written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated (9:13). This is
difficult for us to understand. Why, before Jacob and Esau were ever
born, would God accept one and reject the other? The reason is that
salvation stands by election alone and not by works. God calls and
elects whomever He wishes.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">I can't
honestly look at myself and say that God elected me because I'm so
good. God simply acted on the basis of His own divine sovereignty. The
fact that God chose to elect me thrills me and makes me ever grateful
to Him.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">God chose
between Jacob and Esau before they were born. While they were still in
the womb, He said, "The elder shall serve the younger" (Genesis 25:23b;
Romans 9:12). Of course, God foreknew the attitudes and responses of
each son before he was born. God made His choice with the knowledge
that Jacob would be a spiritual man and Esau a fleshly one. Yet, no one
can say that Jacob was elected because he was so wonderful, kind, or
generous. God simply chose him.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">What
shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? (9:14). Our
logical conclusion to this is that God is unfair. However, as we said
before, carrying the truths of God to our own logical conclusions is
dangerous. There are facts about each case that we don't know or
understand, because our knowledge is limited. We cannot reason as God
or know all the things He knows.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Is there
unrighteousness with God? God forbid (9:14). God does what is right.
His selections are perfectly justified. He bestows His love and grace
upon whom He wills, and He has the right to do so. Thank God that He
chose me!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">You may say, "God didn't choose me."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">"How do you know you're not chosen?"
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">"Because I'm not a Christian."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">"Why don't you accept Jesus?"
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">"I don't want to."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Isn't it
amazing that you don't want to choose God, yet you want to find fault
with Him because He didn't choose you? The only way to know whether or
not He chose you is to believe. You'll then discover that He had chosen
you before you were even born. No one has ever called upon the name of
the Lord and been told, "Sorry, your name isn't on the list."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">I have
even more difficulty when He says, "Jacob have I loved." Jacob wasn't
so lovable. I have some difficulty when God says, "Esau have I hated."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">My
greatest difficulty comes when God says that He loves me. I'm not at
all lovable! God's glorious grace is manifested in His love for any of
us - Jacob, me, or you.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">"For all
have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23). God
would be justified in destroying all men. If God wiped out the human
race, no one could point a finger of accusation at Him. So why are we
accusing God of unfairness when He chooses to redeem some from
destruction?
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Again, we
cannot enter into God's reasoning processes. God operates on a level
far above ours. "For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath
been his counsellor?" (Isaiah 40:13; Romans 11:34). On occasion, we've
all tried to counsel God about how to run this world. He doesn't seem
to be very interested in our ideas. How foolish for us to think that we
can counsel Him. "My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your
ways my ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the
earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your
thoughts" (Isaiah 55:8-9).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For he
saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will
have compassion on whom I will have compassion (9:15). God has the
right to do whatever He wishes. If He has mercy or compassion on some
people, no one can fault Him for that. I thank Him for His mercy and
compassion on me.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">So then
it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that
showeth mercy (9:16). The work of God's favor is out of my hands. It
isn't found by desire or effort "of him that willeth." I may have
worked hard for the Lord, but God's favor isn't found "of him that
runneth." "To God be the glory, great things He hath done," says the
hymn. Salvation is of the Lord.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For the
scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised
thee up, that I might show my power in thee, and that my name might be
declared throughout all the earth. Therefore hath he mercy on whom he
will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth. Thou wilt say then unto
me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?
(9:17-19).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">How can
God blame me for being what I am, since I'm only what He's made me? If
God has chosen to harden my heart, how can He punish me for it? Since
He hardened Pharaoh's heart, how could He hold Pharaoh responsible for
his evil? Who can resist God's will?
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The Book
of Exodus tells us that "the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh." The
Hebrew word for "hardened" means "made firm." God simply confirmed
Pharaoh's own decision, but He didn't make the decision for him. If you
should harden your heart against God and choose to go to hell, God will
make firm your decision. You say, "That's unfair! I want Him to break
me down and change my mind." However, it is fair. If you're
uncomfortable around God and want nothing to do with Him, why should He
force you to live in His presence forever? If you're miserable around
Him, God won't save you. He'll let you spend eternity in the abysmal
darkness far from heaven. Yet you object, "That's unfair!"
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? (9:20a). A good question. Who are you to argue with God?
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Shall the
thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?
Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one
vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour? (9:20b-21). A potter
puts the clay on his wheel and cuts it in half. With one half he can
make a beautiful vessel to hold roses, and with the other half he can
make a spittoon. The potter has the right to make whatever he wants
with his clay. Can the clay that was made into a spittoon say, "Why did
you make me like this?" The clay has no power over its destiny. It's in
the hands of the potter.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The
thought of God's sovereignty is frightening. In fact, the doctrine of
the sovereignty of God would terrify me if I didn't know the full
truth. When I realize that God is love, all fear is suddenly gone.
Without this knowledge, I would resist God and His touch. "Will you
make me into a garbage pail?" Only when I know that God loves me and
chooses the best for me can I yield to the Master Potter.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The
potter knows what he wants to make when he begins to work on a lump of
clay. The clay only discovers the intent of the potter by yielding to
the potter's touch. God has a concept of what He wants me to be when He
starts to work in my life. I can only find the mind of God by yielding
to His touch.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">What if
God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured
with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction
(9:22). God had such patience with Pharaoh! He endured Pharaoh's
rebukes and stubbornness to show the world both His patience with the
rebellious and His wrath on them.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">And that
he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy,
which he had afore prepared unto glory (9:23). Since God can do what He
wants, He can make some vessels fit for destruction by His wrath and
others fit for glory by His mercy.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">God wants
to bestow His mercy upon you as a vessel. He prepares, molds, and fits
you for the glory He wants you to experience in the presence of His
love. The ball is in your court. God offers you His mercy through Jesus
Christ, and you can accept it or reject it.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">To avoid
heresy, these two truths - God's sovereignty and the responsibility of
man - need to be kept in balance. In Chapter 10 we'll take a closer
look at the second truth, man's responsibility to God's call.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Even us,
whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles
(9:24). As God promised through the prophets, the Gentiles now equally
share His mercy with the Jews.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">As he
saith also in Hosea, I will call them my people, which were not my
people; and her beloved, which was not beloved. And it shall come to
pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my
people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.
Isaiah also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children
of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved
(9:25-27). A Jew has no guarantee of salvation and not all of Israel
shall be saved.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For he
will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a
short work will the Lord make upon the earth. And as Isaiah said
before, Except the Lord of Sabbath had left us a seed, we had been as
Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha. What shall we say then? That
the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to
righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith. But Israel,
which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the
law of righteousness. Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith,
but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that
stumblingstone; as it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a
stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him
shall not be ashamed (9:28-33).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Jesus is
the "stumblingstone." The whole idea of righteousness by faith simply
confounded the legalistic Jews. They continued to seek righteousness by
the Law, even after the Cross of Calvary. However, no man has kept the
Law perfectly and attained to righteousness by it. As Peter said about
the Law, "Why...put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which
neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?" (Acts 15:10). Its
fulfillment is beyond the best of men.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">In this
last section of Chapter 9 Paul says that the Gentiles, who don't even
know the Law of Moses, have found the righteousness of God through
faith in Jesus Christ. The Jews, continuing to seek righteousness
through the Law, have never been able to attain it. How glorious is
this righteousness credited to the sinner who believes in Jesus Christ!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul had
written to the Philippians about his past advantages as a Jew. "If any
other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I
more: circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe
of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;
concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness
which is in the law, blameless. But what thing were gain to me, those I
counted loss... for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my
Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count
them but refuse, that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not having
mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through
the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith"
(Philippians 3:4-9).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The Jews
of the Old Testament couldn't approach God When Moses went up to Mount
Sinai, they told him, "Go up and talk to God, then tell us what He
said. We're afraid to go near the place." Seeing the thunder,
lightning, and fire rolling around the mountain, the Jews had reason to
fear the presence of God. They even cordoned off the mountain and
forbade anyone to come near lest he be killed.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The Law
that God established with the Jews was one of exclusion, separating
them from His presence. An ordinary Jew wouldn't dare enter the Holy
Place of the temple; only a true priest had access to it. The common
Jew would never dream of entering the Holy of Holies. Only the high
priest after many ritual washings and sacrifices could approach it once
a year. As a precaution during the high priest's yearly service, the
other priests tied a rope around his foot and attached bells to the
base of his robe. Should the ringing of the bells ever stop while he
was in the Holy of Holies, those outside knew that he had been struck
dead. They would then pull him out with the end of the rope.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Under the
Law God was unapproachable and man was excluded from His presence. Why?
Because a sinful man would be consumed in the presence of a righteous
God. Only one thing today prevents a man from dying in God's presence -
Jesus Christ.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">God has
accounted me as righteous, and I have access to Him at any time. I have
attained the righteousness of the Law through my faith in Jesus Christ.
The Jews under the Law are excluded, for they futilely try to find
righteousness through the works of the Law. "As it is written, Behold,
I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever
believeth on him shall not be ashamed" (Romans 9:33; cf. Isaiah 28:16).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The Jews
have stumbled over the stumbling stone for two millenniums. "But we
preach Christ crucified," Paul said, "unto the Jews a stumblingblock,
and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them which are called, both
Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God" to salvation (I Corinthians
1:23-24).

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Brethren,
my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be
saved (10:1). "I'm not bitter against the Jews," Paul is saying. "My
heart's desire and prayer for these people is for their salvation."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">"For I
bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to
knowledge (10:2). Even today the orthodox Jews have an extreme zeal
toward God. When some young Israelis near Rosh Pina recently accepted
Jesus Christ as their Messiah, several orthodox Jews broke into their
home, beat them up, and damaged their house. Such zeal for God
certainly isn't according to knowledge.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For they
being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish
their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the
righteousness of God (10:3). God has established a righteousness for
all men through faith in Jesus Christ. Without Him, men seek
righteousness by their own rules and standards. "I think that this is
the right thing to do in this situation. I believe that that is the
wrong thing to do." However, the guidelines of men don't meet God's
requirements.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">All men
have standards they live by, even those men who teach situational
ethics. Let's say that a professor stands before a class. He claims
that there are no absolutes - all standards depend upon the mores of
society, truth must be experienced by the individual, and right and
wrong must be personally interpreted. Should a student get up in the
middle of the lecture, walk to the front, sit at the professor's desk,
and start rummaging through his papers, the professor would shout,
"Stop that! You're out of order!"
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">"Do you
mean that I'm doing something wrong?" the student could ask. "Who says
it's wrong? There's no absolute basis of right and wrong. Every man has
to experience truth for himself." In reality, all men have certain
basic concepts that define actions as right or wrong, even though some
deny this fact. Men live by the standards they have set, but their
standards, no matter how high, are unacceptable to God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The Bible
says that our righteous acts are as filthy rags in the sight of God
(Isaiah 64:6). I can parade my good deeds before God. "Look at me! How
do you like this new suit?" Filthy rags! Paul said that he wanted to
"be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the
law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness
which is of God by faith" (Philippians 3:9).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For
Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that
believeth (10:4). Laws or rules cannot make me righteous. Only one
thing can do so: my faith in Jesus Christ. God imparts His
righteousness to me by my faith. If anyone thinks he can improve on
that, good luck!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For Moses
describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which
doeth those things shall live by them (10:5). The righteousness of the
Law was based on what man must do. The righteousness of faith is based
on what Jesus Christ has done. The finished work of Christ forms the
basis of my righteous standing before God. His work is completed,
whereas my righteousness by the Law is continually in progress.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">You may
obey the Law for 85 years and then make one mistake. What a shame! The
Bible says, "Cursed be he that confirmeth [upholds] not all the words
of this law to do them" (Deuteronomy 27:26a). "For whosoever shall keep
the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all" (James
2:10). If you're seeking righteousness by the Law, you're in a
dangerous place. If you're seeking righteousness by Jesus Christ,
you're in the only safe place. God has finished the work for you.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">But the
righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine
heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down
from above:) or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up
Christ again from the dead.) But what saith it? The word is nigh thee,
even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which
we preach; that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus,
and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the
dead, thou shalt be saved (10:6-9).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">How close
are you to true righteousness? "Oh, it's so difficult! I must
practically ascend into heaven, perform glorious deeds, and bring
Christ down from above. I must descend into the deep and raise Him
again from the dead." No such rigid requirements have been given, for
true righteousness is as near to you as your mouth. If thou shalt
confess with thy mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and shalt believe in
thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be
saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with
the mouth confession is made unto salvation (10:9-10). With the
confession of your mouth God regards your past sinful deeds as
nonexistent. When you're that close to salvation, it's folly to be
lost. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is the Lord, believe in
your heart that God raised Him from the dead, and you'll be saved.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For
whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved (10:13).
We discussed the sovereignty of God in the last chapter. Now we come to
the matter of human responsibility. Here the truth finds balance. If
you confess Him and believe in Him, He'll save you, because He keeps
His word. "But what if I'm not predestined?" You'll be saved anyhow. No
one who has called upon the name of the Lord has been turned away. "God
be merciful to me a sinner" (Luke 18:13b) is a prayer that has always
been answered, for God delights to show mercy. So, you're responsible
for calling upon the name of the Lord. And when you do, you'll be
saved.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For the
scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For
there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord
over all is rich unto all that call upon him (10:11-12). God is no less
eager to save a Gentile than to save a Jew. Sometimes we show a
preference toward the Jews, because we're so anxious to have their
spiritual eyes opened again. But God isn't placing any special emphasis
upon them today. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord
shall be saved (10:13). All men are equal in His eyes. However, God
will deal again with Israel, as we'll see in the next chapter.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">How then
shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? How can people
call upon Him unless they have believed in Him? And how shall they
believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear
without a preacher? and how shall they preach, except they be sent?
(10:14-15a). Here Paul follows a chain of thought. Why would men call
upon someone in whom they don't believe? How can they believe in Him
unless they hear about Him? How can they hear about Him unless a
preacher has been sent?
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The whole
missionary thrust of the Church is expressed in these verses. We send
out missionaries for people to hear, believe, and be saved. As it is
written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of
peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! (10:15b). All Christians
share the good things of the Gospel of Christ with a hopeless world.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">But they
have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath
believed our report? So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by
the word of God (10:16-17). The term in verse 17 translated as "word"
isn't logos, which often refers to Christ the living Word, but rhema,
the spoken word of God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">But I
say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the
earth, and their words unto the ends of the world (10:18). Paul is
quoting from the Psalms. "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the
firmament showeth his handiwork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and
night unto night showeth knowledge. There is no speech nor language,
where their voice is not heard" (Psalm 19:1-3). What does this passage
mean? Nature testifies to man about the existence of God. "Have they
not heard?" (10:18). Yes, they surely have heard!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">But I
say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to
jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will
anger you. But Isaiah is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that
sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.
But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands
unto a disobedient and gainsaying [obstinate] people (10:19-21). Paul
tosses back to the Jews their own Scriptures. Even Moses, their father
and greatest leader, prophesied that God would stretch out His hand to
the Gentiles (Deuteronomy 32:21). God did this to provoke the Jews to
jealousy, as they see His grace and goodness bestowed upon Gentiles,
the outcasts.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Rather
than condemn the Jews for their legalistic attitude toward God, we
should demonstrate His love in our midst, the power of the Spirit, and
the joy of our Redeemer and Messiah. In our efforts to evangelize the
Jews, we should show such a love and excitement about the Messiah that
the Jews are provoked to jealousy. Let them stop and say, "He's our
Messiah, you know!" And He is.

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">I say
then, Hath God cast away his people? (11:1a). This is an important
question. Some preachers today are saying, "God has cast away His
people." They claim that all the prophecies concerning the natural
branch of Israel were fulfilled when Titus destroyed the nation in A.D.
70. They believe that God is now through with the Jews.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">I receive
many letters from people who read my books and try to correct me for
what they think is my misunderstanding of prophecy. They believe that
the Israel of the Old Testament is the Church of today and the Jews of
the Bible are now the Christians. In their minds all the present and
future prophecies for Israel and the Jews find fulfillment in the
Church. Such an interpretation leads these people to an incorrect view
of biblical prophecy. Almost without exception, everyone who teaches
that the Jews have had their chance and God has cut them off also
teaches that the Church will go through the Great Tribulation.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">But God
hasn't cut off His people. Hath God cast away his people? God forbid
[perish the thought]. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of
Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. God hath not cast away his people
which he foreknew (11:1-2a).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Wot
[know] ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah? how he maketh
intercession to God against Israel (11:2b). Notice that Elijah made
intercession against Israel, not for her. How would you feel if a
pastor prayed against you? Elijah prayed, Lord, they [Israelites] have
killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone,
and they seek my life (11:3). Elijah thought things couldn't get worse.
"They've killed everybody who loves You. I'm the only one left, and
they're trying to kill me. You're almost out of troops, Lord!"
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">How did
God answer the distraught prophet? I have reserved to myself seven
thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal. Even so
then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the
election of grace (11:4-5). That "present time" holds to our day. God
has a remnant among the Jews who believe and trust in Jesus as their
Messiah. They share in the glorious blessings of God just as we
Christians do.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">And if by
grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace.
But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no
more work (11:6). I'm accepted by God either wholly by my works or
wholly by His grace. I can't be accepted partly by one and partly by
the other. If I'm accepted by grace then works have nothing to do with
my salvation. The Good News is that my acceptance is wholly by His
grace.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">What
then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the
election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded (according as it
is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they
should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day
(11:7-8). Israel has been blinded by God. Those Jews still trying to
relate to God through the Law haven't yet received His grace.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">In fact,
the Jews don't even keep the covenant of the Law anymore. You say,
"They observe the Sabbath, light their candles, eat their kosher meals,
have their washings, and such." Yes, but where are the sacrifices for
their sins? They have none. They seek to approach God totally through
works. Their religion is the same as Cain's, presenting the works of
their hands. As God rejected Cain, so He's rejecting the Jews and the
works offered in atonement for their sins. Good works never cover a
man's sins. The Jews have been blinded, because they have rejected the
grace offered by God through Jesus the Messiah.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">And David
saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a
stumblingblock, and a recompense unto them: let their eyes be darkened,
that they may not see, and bow down their back always (11:9-10). Paul
quotes from one of the messianic psalms prophesying the death of Jesus
Christ. "In my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink" (Psalm 69:21b).
This psalm prophesies the words of Christ, and these words have been
fulfilled upon Israel. The "table" of communion by which the Jews once
came to God has become a stumbling block, because they reject the
significance of Christ's Last Supper. Their backs are bowed down and
their eyes are darkened to His truth.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">I say
then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather
through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke
them to jealousy (11:11). Are the Jews entirely removed from God's
plan? No. They've been broken off temporarily from the good olive tree,
but they'll be grafted in again. While the Jews are temporarily cut
off, the door has been opened for the Gentiles to enter into God's
grace.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Now if
the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of
them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness? (11:12).
If blessings have come to us through their fall, how much greater the
blessings when the Jews enter their fullness. What will this blessing
be? The Kingdom Age.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">God will
restore the Jews to His love and favor when He opens their eyes and
they receive Christ. The fullness of the glorious kingdom of God will
then be come. Zechariah testified to this day, saying, "And one shall
say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall
answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends"
(Zechariah 13:6). Again the prophet said, "And they shall look upon me
whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth
for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in
bitterness for his firstborn" (Zechariah 12:10b). One day the Jews will
realize their blindness and folly. They'll accept Jesus Christ, and the
glorious national restoration of these people will bring in the Kingdom
Age.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For I
speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I
magnify mine office: if by any means I may provoke to emulation
[jealousy] them which are my flesh, and might save some of them
(11:13-14). Paul certainly did arouse their emotions. The Jews
considered his ministry to the Gentiles as sacrilegious.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Just his
presence in the temple once provoked the Jews into trying to kill Paul.
When order had been restored by the soldiers, Paul began talking to the
Jews in their tongue. "Brothers, listen to me! I've lived all my life
as a good Jew. I was zealous just like you. I understand your feelings.
I tried to stop this new heresy. I persecuted these Christians. The
high priest and all the Council can testify of my zeal."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">"In fact,
I was on my way to Damascus to persecute the Church there. About noon
as I neared the city, a light came from heaven. I fell on the ground
and heard a voice saying, 'Why do you persecute me?' I said, 'Who are
you, Lord? I want to serve you.' The voice answered, 'I am Jesus whom
you are persecuting. I am going to send you to the Gentiles."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">When the
Jews heard this, they began to scream, taking their coats off and
throwing dirt in the air. "Kill him! Rid the earth of him! He doesn't
deserve to live!" (Acts 21:27-22:23). Why? Because Paul claimed that
God had sent him to the Gentiles with the message of salvation. Such a
claim provoked the Jews to frenzy.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For if
the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world - if God was
able to reconcile the Gentile world to Himself by their rejection -
what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead? (11:15).
God's future acceptance of the Jews will bring life, the Kingdom Age,
to the world.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For if
the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy,
so are the branches. And if some of the branches [Jews] be broken off,
and thou, being a wild olive tree [Gentiles], were grafted in among
them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree
(11:16-17). As a Gentile, a wild branch, I've been grafted into the
tree of the promises, covenants, and blessings of God. By being grafted
into Christ, I'm a partaker of God's promises and a beneficiary of all
the promises to Israel.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Boast not
against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but
the root thee (11:18). You're not holding yourself up, the root is
supporting you. So don't boast. You stand only by the grace of God and
the mercies of Jesus Christ.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Thou wilt
say, then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.
Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by
faith. Be not highminded, but fear (11:19-20). We must not boast
against the Jews or look down on them. We should never think, "God cut
them off so that I might be grafted in." We've been grafted in by faith
- not because we're worthy, or deserving, or because God saw something
special in us. We stand by faith. They were cut off because of
unbelief.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For if
God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest He also spare not
thee (11:21). Since God cut off the natural branches, then the wild
branch that's been grafted in can also be cut off.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Behold
therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell,
severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness:
otherwise thou also shalt be cut off (11:22). Your standing with God
appears conditional; you must continue in His goodness. Jesus said,
"Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself,
except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me...
If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is
withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they
are burned" (John 15:4,6).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">And they
also, if they abide not still in unbelief - if the Jews cease in their
unbelief of Christ - shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them
in again. For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by
nature, and wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how
much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into
their own olive tree? For I would not, brethren, that ye should be
ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits;
that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the
Gentiles be come in (11:23-25).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">This
blindness has happened to Israel until "the fullness of the Gentiles be
come in." This indicates that God has chosen a certain number among the
Gentiles to believe. They constitute the fullness of the Gentiles. I
believe that the moment the last Gentile chosen by God surrenders his
life to Jesus Christ and is born again that this dispensation will come
to an immediate close. The Lord will then gather His Church to Himself,
and God will once again deal with the nation Israel as His people.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">In Daniel
9 the angel told Daniel that there were 70 sevens determined upon the
nation Israel. From the time that the commandment goes forth to restore
and rebuild Jerusalem to the coming of the Messiah the Prince would be
69 sevens. The angel then said that the Messiah would be cut off
without receiving for Himself (the kingdom). The seventieth seven-year
cycle of Daniel is yet future. Jesus referred to it in Matthew 24 as
the time when the Antichrist will stand in the Holy Place. In II
Thessalonians 2:4 Paul said that this Antichrist will there declare
that he is God. This has not yet happened, so it's yet to come. Thus,
we're still in the time of the Gentiles, waiting for the fullness of
the Gentiles to come in.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">And so
all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of
Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: for
this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins. As
concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching
the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes. For the gifts
and calling of God are without repentance (11:26-29). God hasn't
changed. He has called the Jews, and they're still His elect.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Notice
that God calls these future Jewish believers His "election." This helps
us to understand the prophecy in Matthew's gospel. "Immediately after
the tribulation of those days they shall see the Son of man coming in
the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And he shall send his
angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together
his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other"
(Matthew 24:29-31). The "elect" refers to Jewish believers, and these
prophecies in Matthew 24 are on Jewish ground.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Some
Christians use Matthew 24 as proof that the Church won't be gathered to
Christ until after the Tribulation and the return of Jesus. Not so.
This passage will be the fulfillment of God's promise to His elect
people, the Jews.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Jesus
said, "Pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the
Sabbath day" (Matthew 24:20). How many Christians would hesitate to
travel on a Saturday, the Sabbath? We're free to travel as much as we
want in all directions on Saturday. However, a Jew seeking
righteousness by the Law cannot walk more than two-thirds of a mile on
the Sabbath day.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Some
people say that God has cut off Israel and is finished with them. No,
"God forbid." As Augustine said, "If you understand the dispensations,
everything else is simple." Thinking that God is finished with Israel
brings confusion. The greatest revival in the world is yet to take
place, as God again draws these people to Himself, opens their eyes,
and they recognize Him. What a beautiful day that will be!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For as ye
in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy
through their unbelief: even so have these also now not believed, that
through your mercy they also may obtain mercy. For God hath concluded
them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all (11:30-32). The
mercy of God has now been extended to all men. The Jews are now in
unbelief. In this position they're able to receive the mercy of God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">O the
depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how
unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out! (11:33).
We've been looking at the ways of God - His sovereignty, calling,
election - and we find these difficult to understand. For years I
sought to reconcile divine sovereignty and human responsibility,
eternal security and free moral agency. I pondered them, but I found it
futile to search the judgments of God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">One day
in exasperation I slammed down my fist and said, "God, I cannot
reconcile Your sovereignty with my responsibility!" God spoke to my
heart clearly and said, "I never asked you to reconcile it. I only
asked you to believe it." I've had peace ever since.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">I still
cannot reconcile the difficulties, but I don't have to. I just accept
and believe in these truths which remain to me irreconcilable. God is
absolutely sovereign and can do whatever He wants. He can harden my
heart, show me mercy, damn me, or save me. I believe that I can choose
to call upon the Lord and be saved. He is sovereign, yet I have the
choice. Though I cannot reconcile that, I believe it.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For who
hath known the mind of the Lord? (11:34a). How can I understand the
mind of God or think as He thinks? "Such knowledge is too wonderful for
me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it" (Psalm 139:6). Or who hath
been his counselor? (11:34b). God doesn't need my advice. He can run
the universe without me telling Him how to do it. How many times have I
been so foolish as to try to counsel God?
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Or who
hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?
(11:35). God will not be a debtor to any man. Jesus said, "Give, and it
shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken
together, and running over" (Luke 6:38). This is one of the spiritual
laws that God has established in the world. We're familiar with the
natural laws of the universe, such as electricity, magnetism, and
gravity, and we've learned to use them for our advantage. Though I
don't understand how the law of electricity functions, it doesn't keep
me from turning on the lights.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">People
often fail to realize that God has also established spiritual laws as
predictable in cause and effect as natural laws. We cannot give to God
without Him multiplying back to us. Because we cannot understand how
the spiritual laws operate, we often fail to use them. I cannot
understand why the more I give to God the more I'll receive, but I know
that it works.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For of
Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all things: to whom be glory for
ever. Amen (11:36). Paul ends Chapter 11 with this wonderful doxology.
To God be glory forever! For it's all wrapped up in Him. The universe
with all its processes, all the realms of understanding and logic, all
the love, mercy, and grace belong to Him.

  <tbody><tr>
    <td><center><h4>12. The Living Sacrifice</h4></center></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">In several
of his Epistles Paul gently but earnestly uses the phrase, "I beseech
you." This is the way God talks to us. He doesn't say, "I demand this!"
Rather, He speaks to us quite tenderly. I beseech you therefore,
brethren (12:1a).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">"Therefore"
always refers to a prior thought and links the present statement with
it. This "therefore" takes us back to the comments on the love, mercy,
and grace of God which have provided our election, calling,
justification, and glorification. Because we're now justified, Paul
urges, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living
sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service
(12:1b).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">"Reasonable"
is translated from a Greek word meaning "logical." To commit my life to
God for Him to direct is logical, because God knows the end of a matter
from the beginning. God's wisdom is so much greater than mine. He has
never made a mistake and never will. I have made many mistakes and
still do. It makes good sense to seek His counsel and guidance and to
give my life to His direction.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">God could
work apart from human instruments. He could use angels to do His work,
and they could probably do a much better job. I wish He would use His
angels instead of some of the hucksters I've seen on television. In any
event, God has chosen to use people like you and me to do His work.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Rather
than offer a slain sacrifice as in the Old Testament, you're to offer
your body as a living sacrifice. Present your body as an instrument in
God's hands, and He'll use you to accomplish His work in the hearts and
lives of those around you.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">And be
not conformed to this world (12:2a). Immense pressures are working to
conform you to this world's system. If you don't conform, the
advertising agencies make you think that you're missing out on life.
Peer pressure and the mores of society are powerful instruments in
Satan's hands. Yet we're told, Be ye transformed by the renewing of
your mind (12:2b).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">A great
difference exists between "conformed" and "transformed." Earlier in
Romans Paul said, "Ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be
that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit
of Christ, he is none of his" (Romans 8:9). Paul was explaining the two
sides of man's nature, flesh and spirit. Being "Transformed by the
renewing of your mind" means that your mind is no longer occupied with
the fleshly side of your nature.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Many
people seek to relate man to animals, because they want to live like
animals. Animals don't possess a spirit and live solely on a
body-conscious level. So, the man who wants to feel free of any
responsibility to God disclaims his spiritual capacities and proclaims
himself a highly evolved animal. He's constantly searching for the
missing link between himself and the ape. Natural man does have a
missing link, but it's not between him and the animal kingdom. It's
between him and God. Man, created in the image of God, has fallen from
the spirit-controlled being he once was to the flesh-controlled
creature he has become. Now God seeks to restore man into His image by
the new birth.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Jesus
said, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born
of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be
born again" (John 3:6-7). The mind of the flesh is death, but the mind
of the Spirit is life and peace (Romans 8:6). By living on the
spiritual side of life, your mind is occupied with the things of God.
By this transformation from flesh to spirit, you're born again and your
mind is renewed.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">That ye
may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God
(12:2c). The desire expressed in many hearts is: "If I only knew God's
will for my life." So many want to do the perfect will of God, but
unfortunately don't know what it is.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Here Paul
gives a two-step method for knowing the will of God for your life.
First, present your body to God. Writing to the Corinthians, Paul
asked, "Don't you know that your body is the temple of the Holy
Spirit?" (I Corinthians 6:19). God has made a claim on your body, and
He wants you to yield it to Him so that it's under the control of His
Spirit. Second, you must not be conformed to this dead world, but be
transformed in your mind to the world of the Spirit. When you present
your body as an instrument in God's hand, you become a nonconformist to
this world of sin and you're transformed by His Spirit. Then you find
God's will for your life.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">I believe
that God reveals His will to me daily. I get up in the morning and say,
"God, today my life is Yours. My body is available for You to use as
You see fit. Lead me, guide me, and work out Your perfect will in my
life." God reveals His will to me, because I've asked Him and trust Him
to do just that.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Too often
we assume that God only reveals His will in exotic ways such as
tinglings down the spine or fiery letters in the sky. When I entered
Bible college, I learned that some students had seen visions or
messages emblazoned in the sky calling them into the ministry. I didn't
have any such experiences. Actually, I had the least spectacular call
to the ministry of anyone in school. All I had was a desire to serve
God by learning more of His Word.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">After all
these years I'm one of the few from my class still in the ministry.
Many former classmates are selling cars or working in some such
occupation. I sometimes wonder what happened to those fiery letters in
the sky.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">When we
expect the will or call of God to come in dramatic ways, we don't
anticipate the natural ways by which He so often leads us. Many times
during the day God's hand is leading me, but I'm not even aware of it.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Some
people expect a divine signal system to give them directions. "Turn
left! Beep! Beep! Go forward" They're looking for the spectacular, so
they bemoan the fact that they've never been led by God. In looking
over my life's situations, I realize that God has worked out things
with perfect timing. My hindsight shows me that my promptings to do a
particular thing had come from God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">God leads
us in natural ways. He said that He would write His Law on the tablets
of our hearts (II Corinthians 3:3). He places in our hearts the desire
to do a particular thing. After we do it, we realize that the prompting
came from God. It's wonderful to realize that we were listening to God,
got His message straight, and played a part in a particular
circumstance for His glory. The awareness of God's hand upon our lives
is an overwhelming and humbling experience.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">So often
God leads us one step at a time. In the midst of a successful revival
in Samaria, Philip was told by God, "Go down to Gaza, which is desert."
Philip obeyed the prompting of God, and when he came to Gaza he saw the
chariot with the Ethiopian eunuch. The Lord said, "Go near and join
him" (Acts 8:26-29). The second step in the leading didn't come until
Philip had obeyed the first. If he had disobeyed the first command, he
never would have received the second. Thus, he never would have known
what God's will was for him in Gaza. We often demand to know God's
reasoning; but the revelation of His will to our lives is progressive,
as we obey step by step.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For I
say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you,
not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to
think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of
faith (12:3). Thinking more highly of myself than I ought is one of my
greatest problems in serving God. In trying to find the reasons why God
chose me, I sometimes think that He knew He could trust me. However,
God uses me simply because He wants to. As a human instrument, I must
beware the danger of accepting the glory that belongs to God. Lest I
ever be puffed up because God uses me, I remember the instrument that
He chose to speak to Balaam: a simple donkey (Numbers 22:22-33).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">When God
places the anointing of His Spirit on you as His instrument, people
will oftentimes magnify you as someone special. You can't stop them,
but you can refuse to accept their plaudits. When Peter and John were
used by God to heal the lame man in the temple, the people gathered
around Peter. They looked at him in awe, as if to say, "You must be a
very holy man for God to use you. "
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Peter
pointed to the healed man and said, "Men of Israel, why do you marvel
at this? Why do you stare at us as though we through our own power or
godliness have made this fellow walk? This is the power of Jesus Christ
demonstrated to you. Glorify Him!" (Acts 3:1-16).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Peter
knew that he was a blunderer and a weakling. Jesus had told him, "The
spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak" (Matthew 26:41b). So
when the Lord anointed and used him, Peter wasn't about to take any
credit for it.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">When God
begins to anoint you, don't take the credit. Paul asked, "What do you
have that you did not receive?" (I Corinthians 4:7b). If you've been
given a talent, ability, or gift, why go around as though it came from
you? If God didn't put intelligence in you, you'd be a babbling idiot.
You can think and reason only because He has given you the ability. So
never magnify yourself or your abilities.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Because
of the beautiful inspiration of the Spirit, I'll occasionally deliver a
really good sermon. Once, after an especially good one, I was walking
toward the back of the church and the devil was on my shoulder. He
said, "You gave a great sermon! You really blessed the people today!"
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The Lord
was speaking to me also. He said, "What did you give but what you
received?" I said, "Nothing, Lord." He said, "Then you won't take
credit for it, will you?" I said, "No way, Lord!" Whatever I have has
come from God. Paul says that every man ought to think soberly,
according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith (12:3b).
Man has a tendency to exalt the idea of faith, and this can easily
become a matter of spiritual pride. "God does such wonderful things
through me because of my great faith." As though a man's faith was at
the center of God's great work!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul
said, "By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves:
it is the gift of God" (Ephesians 2:8). You may say, "What? We don't
get any credit?" No. God gave us the necessary measure of faith to
believe in the grace that He was offering. If He hadn't given us that
faith, we couldn't believe. We'd still be out in the dark, looking in.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Peter
explained to the wondering throng how the lame man was walking and
leaping: "Yes, the faith which is by Him" (Acts 3:16). The faith for
the miracle had come by Jesus Christ. Peter wasn't even claiming the
faith as his own. This is quite revealing in light of all the proddings
we receive nowadays to greater faith. Faith is God's gift to us, and He
has given to each man a measure of faith.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For as we
have many members in one body, and all members have not the same
office: so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one
members one of another (12:4-5). After going to such great lengths to
bring Christians together, God must grieve over a body that is so
divided, splintered, and antagonistic. Be thankful that your body isn't
in the same shape as the Church body, where one eye wants nothing to do
with the other because it doesn't see things exactly the same way. At
times the body of Christ must look spastic with its fightings,
jealousies, and divisions. How tragic to see members tearing one
another down.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">What does
a non-Christian think when he sees the division in the body of Christ?
He goes away with the impression that the body of Christ is sick.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Though it
is one, the body has many members, and every part has a different
purpose. We're members one of another. In a sense, the Holy Spirit is
the nervous system coordinating the work of the body. Under His
direction the parts work together smoothly to make a strong witness to
the world. I thank God for the body's witness when the Spirit is
directing it. As Paul wrote to the Romans, "Your faith is spoken of
throughout the whole world" (Romans 1:8b). Our faith is known worldwide
when the body is functioning properly. If only we'd forget our
denominational allegiances! </font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">I don't
think that all Christians should meet in the same church. The variety
of gatherings with the different modes of worship is important, as it
meets the many particular needs within the body of Christ. However, we
shouldn't develop our own exclusive club where we look down on others
and say, "They don't worship or teach like we do." Remember, we're one
body, and God uses each fellowship as a light to reach the world around
it.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Everyone
has a function within the body. The ear is as important as the mouth.
God has called me to be a mouth, but if you don't have ears to hear,
what good is a mouth? The body must have input as well as output.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Having
then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us
(12:6a). God gives each one a gift suitable for his ministry within the
body. We often ask for gifts, as the Scripture says, "Covet earnestly
the best gifts" (I Corinthians 12:31a). For a long time I desired
certain gifts that I didn't have. I fasted, prayed, and promised to use
them in the right way, but God hasn't seen fit to give them to me. The
last time I talked to Him about it, He let me know what my gift was and
told me to be satisfied with that.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">"But Lord, I want the gift of healing. Think of what I could do with it!" 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">He said, "Charles, I called you to teach."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">God
impressed His answer upon my heart, and He told me that He had already
bestowed upon me the more excellent way. I said, "Thank You, Lord. I'll
take it." It's so exciting to be an instrument through which God shows
His love!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">If you
have the gift of prophecy, then you should prophesy according to the
proportion of faith (12:6b). What does that mean? Sometimes the Lord
will give you an unusual prophecy and you may not have enough faith to
speak it. "Lord, is this really from You? What if I speak it and it
doesn't happen?" I've been in that boat many times. The Lord has given
me prophecies on numerous occasions, but I didn't utter them due to a
lack of faith. Once the unspoken prophecy had come true, I wished I had
uttered it.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The gift
of prophecy must be exercised according to your proportion of faith. Of
course, you're putting your gift on the line by speaking. If you utter
something in the name of the Lord and it doesn't come to pass, then you
- not the Lord - made a mistake.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Or
ministry, let us wait on our ministering (12:7a). We often make a
mistake by thinking that the ministry means standing behind the pulpit.
No, that isn't where real ministry takes place. True ministry means
serving one another. Some people have a wonderful way of exercising
this gift. Others exercise it so you feel obligated to them, because
they keep reminding you of their service. Actually, all the gifts can
be exercised in good or bad ways. We need the guidance of the Spirit in
using His gifts.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Or he
that teacheth, on teaching (12:7b). If your gift is teaching, I believe
that you should be first and foremost a student. The Bible says that
the Holy Spirit will bring to your remembrance "whatsoever I have said
unto you" (John 14:26b). This means that you must have learned His
sayings. Thus, the gift of teaching requires diligent study of the Word
of God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Or he
that exhorteth, on exhortation (12:8a). Exhortation is an extremely
important gift in the Church. Sometimes we need to be pushed in the
right direction, like the little boy on the diving board. He wants to
jump. Everybody is yelling "Jump!" But he's too scared. He walks off
the board, then back on again. He needs someone to come up and give him
a push.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The
exhorter gives us a little shove in the right direction. He encourages
us to trust the Lord, believe the promises of God, and open our hearts
in worship and praise to Him. He exhorts us to action by applying the
truths of God in our particular walk.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">He that
giveth, let him do it with simplicity (12:8b). Did you know that there
is a gift of giving? Some Christians have this special touch from God.
If that is your gift, "do it with simplicity." Otherwise, you can make
your giving a complicated matter by wrapping strings around it.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">There is
also the gift of ruling. He that ruleth, with diligence (12:8c). A
person with this gift should diligently govern those under his
authority.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">He that
sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness (12:8d). What a valuable gift! When
I'm going through a bad time, I don't want to talk with someone who
won't sympathize. I need understanding and comfort, so I look for a
Christian with the gift of mercy. If you have this gift, exercise it
with cheerfulness. Enter into the person's suffering and then lift him
with the cheerfulness of the Spirit.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Let love
be without dissimulation [be sincere]. Abhor that which is evil (12:9).
One of the major weaknesses of the Church is a great tolerance for
evil. We've practically established peaceful coexistence with the works
of darkness. However, we're supposed to resist them. We need to hate
evil and cleave to that which is good (12:9b).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Be kindly
affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring
one another (12:10). Each verse in Chapter 12 is a complete message in
itself and displays Paul's gift of exhortation in operation.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Not
slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord (12:11).
Christians must consciously do all things as unto the Lord. It hurts me
when a Christian separates his business from his spiritual life. Once I
did business with a fellow in the church. When I questioned him about
the product, he gave me a line that I'd expect to hear from a con man.
I also grieve whenever one of the sheep is cheated by another member of
the church. The whole concept behind a business operated by a Christian
is to serve the Lord. Whatever he does in word or deed should be for
God (Colossians 3:17). You can't cheat a brother for the glory of God.
Anyone guilty of this is deceived by his own greed. Many divisions
sprout up within the body because of these unethical business
practices.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Rejoicing
in hope (12:12a). It's impossible to rejoice in all circumstances.
However, I can always rejoice in the Lord, lifting myself above
circumstances and fixing my eyes on Him. I can always rejoice in hope,
because I can always hope that the circumstances will improve. "I can't
get any lower, but the Lord will see me through!"
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The Word
of God never tells us to rejoice in circumstances themselves. Some
people encourage us to do that, but it's unrealistic. I like practical
Christianity, and that's what the Bible gives us.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Be
patient in tribulation (12:12b). "Tribulation worketh patience" (Romans
5:3). As we said before, these two are often tied together. When we
pray for patience, we usually experience tribulation. This teaches us
the very patience we need.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Continuing
instant in prayer; distributing to the necessity of saints; given to
hospitality. Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.
Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep. Be of
the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend
to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits. Recompense to
no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men
(12:12b-17). This is Paul's exhortation to practical Christianity.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">If it be
possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men (12:18).
I'm glad that Paul admits that this is sometimes impossible. Still, we
must never be the cause for strife with others. Living peaceably with
all men means that we overlook things, ignore statements, and pass off
irritations. Sometimes it's much better to pretend that we didn't hear
a certain remark. Unfortunately, some people spill out their poison
louder a second time. Then we know that peace is impossible. In any
case, we're never to curse or lash back at them. Certain people are
crude, but that's no excuse for us to act the same way. If they want to
have their say, let them. Don't recompense evil for evil.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul
continues, Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place
unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith
the Lord. Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give
him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head
(12:19-20).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">A
Scripture may seem obscure because we're not familiar with the customs
of the day. Heaping coals of fire on a person's head wasn't a cruel
act. In biblical times people carried containers of charcoal on their
heads. Sometimes they'd have to walk far to get live coals to start
their fire at home. Heaping live coals on someone's head wasn't a curse
but a favor.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Finally, Paul says, Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good (12:21).

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Let every
soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of
God: the powers that be are ordained of God (13:1). I accept this
Scripture as the truth, but I don't always agree with God's choices of
those in power.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">God
ordains some leaders who bungle the job badly. Such rulers become
instruments to ripen a nation for judgment. Their mismanagement and
injustices totally manifest the country's corruption so that no one
questions God's judgment when it falls.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">We know
that our country needs judgment today, and we're being ripened for it.
The deteriorating moral climate in the United States is reflected in
the decisions made by our courts. Judicial decisions have been one of
the greatest factors in opening the floodgates of corruption and
immorality upon our land.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">I believe
that God has given our judges the power to make these landmark
decisions. Because of this, I believe that He wants to bring judgment
upon our immoral society, and He'll be blameless when He does.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">When God
told King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon that his kingdom would fall to the
Medo-Persian empire, the king built a ninety-foot golden image. He set
up the statue in defiance of God's word and demanded that men worship
it as a symbol of an eternal Babylon. "Is not this great Babylon that I
have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and
for the honour of my majesty?" (Daniel 4:30).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For these
things God allowed Nebuchadnezzar to go insane. The king lived with the
oxen for seven seasons. The dew of the heavens settled upon him, he ate
grass in the fields, his nails grew like claws, and his hair like
feathers covered his body - until he realized the truth. God in heaven
establishes the kingdoms of men and puts in charge whomever He wishes.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Then
Nebuchadnezzar made a proclamation about God. "He doeth according to
his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth:
and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?" (Daniel
4:35). The king of Babylon came to his conclusion the difficult way.
It's much easier just to believe that Romans 13:1 is true!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Whosoever
therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God and they
that resist shall receive unto themselves damnation. For rulers are not
a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid
of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the
same (13:2-3). You don't need to fear the police as long as you obey
the law. When you're traveling at the speed limit, you're not afraid.
When you're traveling 25 miles-an-hour above the speed limit and pass a
black-and-white car with a radar scanner in the side window, fear grips
your heart.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Those who
enforce the law aren't a threat or terror to you when you're obedient.
Law-abiding citizens receive praise from the civil authorities. A
police officer is only a terror to those who do evil works, for he is
the minister of God to thee for good (13:4a). The next time you're
stopped for speeding or violating the law, don't be nasty or angry. The
officer may have saved your life. Be thankful for the police. If they
weren't enforcing the laws, our society would be a much worse jungle
than it is now.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">But if
thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in
vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon
him that doeth evil. Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for
wrath, but also for conscience sake (13:4b-5). Be obedient to the law,
not just because you're afraid of getting thrown in jail, but because
of conscience.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For this
cause pay ye tribute [taxes] also: for they are God's ministers,
attending continually upon this very thing (13:6). Yes, they do "attend
continually!" Christians should pay their taxes. Render therefore to
all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom
(13:7a). Pay the taxes, pay the customs. If you bought a taxable item
in another country, don't try to sneak it past customs.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Give fear
to whom fear; honour to whom honour. Owe no man any thing, but to love
one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law
(13:7b-8). Jesus said basically the same thing. The lawyer asked Him,
"What is the greatest commandment?" Jesus replied, "Love the Lord your
God with all your heart, soul, and mind, and love your neighbor as
yourself. On these two commandments hang all the law" (Matthew
22:35-40). The Law of God is simply summed up in love.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The
Mosaic Law contained a negative note, "Thou shalt not..." (Deuteronomy
5:6-21). Jesus turned to a positive note: love God, love one another.
We don't have to worry about the negatives.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Many
people think that they're good because they don't do anything bad. It's
much better to approach life with a positive attitude and let God's
love flow through your heart. For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery,
Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false
witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment,
it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love
(13:9). Once you have the positive, you can eliminate the negative.
Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling
of the law (13:10). Everyone who loves has fulfilled the Law.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Now Paul
gives the final thought of the chapter. And that, knowing the time,
that now it is high time to awake out of sleep (13:11a). God doesn't
want the coming of Christ to take you by surprise.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Jesus
said, "Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.
But know this, that if the goodman [owner] of the house had known in
what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not
have suffered [allowed] his house to be broken up" (Matthew 24:42-43).
He has given you the signs of His return, so it shouldn't catch you by
surprise. For you're not children of "darkness, that that day should
overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of light, and the
children of the day" (I Thessalonians 5:4-5a). Therefore, "walk as
children of light" (Ephesians 5:8b).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">It's high
time to wake up, look around at the world, and realize that this age is
coming to an end. For now is our salvation nearer than when we believed
(13:11b). Every day brings us that much closer to the return of Jesus
Christ. The night is far spent, the day is at hand (13:12a). Satan has
had control of the world since Adam turned it over to him, almost six
thousand years ago. What a horrible night it's been!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Our
nation has been corrupted by greed. Christopher Columbus believed that
God was sending him as a light-bearer to a people in darkness. He wrote
in his diary that the Holy Spirit led and directed his mission. When
his crew saw the treasures of the Indians, the holy passion of reaching
the natives for the Lord was turned into a lustful passion for gold.
The explorers raped and murdered the Indians. Spain moved into Mexico,
and so unfolded the horrible story of plundering, killing, and
enslavement, all because of the greed for gold.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">England's
Jamestown colony was founded when English ministers encouraged their
people to share the Gospel with the Indians in the New World. Again,
greed overcame John Smith and his followers. The Indians were treated
as inferiors, robbed, and murdered. The mission of the Jamestown
community was doomed from the beginning.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Finally
the Pilgrims came. They landed at Plymouth Rock and established the
first successful colonization of the land. They shared the Gospel, made
peace with the Indians, and maintained high moral standards. Their
writings and colony prove that God's hand was upon them. Because these
settlers were truly seeking to serve God, Plymouth Colony was a
successful community.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">On the
first Thanksgiving Day the Pilgrims gave thanks to God for His care.
Their provision hadn't been bountiful. During their first winter the
daily ration of corn was five grains per person. However, God sustained
them, and our nation was established on their religious and moral
principles.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Today the
term "Puritan" carries a negative connotation, but we need to be
thankful for the puritan ethic established in America's early history.
Were it not for these standards, our society would have collapsed long
ago. When the light of the Gospel was fading in England and on the
Continent, God began to raise up America as the new light of hope for
all men. For a time the light did shine. Unfortunately, the darkness is
moving in once again, and America has become a home for every kind of
spiritual and moral blight. It's high time that we awoke, for the
"night is far spent." There are no more frontiers to conquer where God
can establish a new light. The day is at hand when God will once again
intervene in the history of man.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Let us
therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour
of light. Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and
drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness [sexual immorality and
debauchery], not in strife and envying (13:12b-13). Let's live on
life's positive side. Let us walk honestly... Put ye on the Lord Jesus
Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts
thereof (13:13a,14). Don't gratify the desires of your flesh. We need
to be caring about the Lord's business. There's so much to be
accomplished... and the time is so short!

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul now
encourages us to receive those who are weak in the faith but not to
doubtful disputations (14:1). If a person is weak in the faith, receive
him, but don't get into any big arguments.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">It's
tragic that in some churches a Christian must prove himself before he's
received into the fellowship. Paul tells us to accept all people,
whether they're spiritually mature or babes in Christ.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul
gives two examples of believers weak in the faith: those who refuse to
eat meat and those who insist on a particular day of worship. These
Christians don't have enough faith to trust in the Lord completely.
They feel that their righteousness still depends on keeping certain
ordinances. You should love them, but don't debate these issues with
them.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For one
believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak in the faith
eateth herbs [vegetables]. Let not him that eateth despise him that
eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for
God hath received him (14:2-3).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Different
people have different convictions. A particular conviction may be good
for one individual and wrong for another. God doesn't deal with us in
the same ways, but meets us at our own levels. Some Christians have a
strong conviction against going to public beaches and think that all
Christians should avoid them. If going to a beach brings you problems
of lust, then you shouldn't go. But you shouldn't set a universal
Christian standard because of your own personal hang-up.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">If God
has convicted someone about eating meat, that person shouldn't eat
meat. By the same token, he shouldn't assume that God has convicted
everyone of the same thing and that anyone eating meat is a backslider.
According to Paul, those who are weak in the faith eat vegetables;
those who are strong in the faith eat anything. Paul said that all
things are to be received with thanksgiving (Philippians 4:6). The New
Testament prescribes no dietary restrictions as found in the Old
Testament, and a Christian can eat pork or ham without violating any
biblical precept.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">If you
have a strong conviction, don't judge those who lack it. Likewise, if
you have no conviction, don't condemn those who are convicted. Simply
accept and receive one another in love.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">If you
have an opinion on a Scripture that the rest of the church needs to
know, then let them see how it works in your own life. As they see your
belief conform you into the image of Christ, they'll be attracted to
you. They'll approach you and ask questions. Then you'll have an
opportunity to share your particular persuasion. Meanwhile, don't try
to force your opinions on others or insist that they see things your
way. The body of Christ needs to show greater latitude on these
personal issues. Let's avoid divisions over the various ways we cross
our 't's' and dot our 'i's'.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Who art
thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth
or falleth (14:4a). We're not to judge one another because we're not
the master. Every Christian belongs to God and serves Him. You have no
business judging another man's servant. His own master will judge him,
and before his master a servant stands or falls.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Yea, he
shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand (14:4b). Many
people thought that I would never make it through Bible college,
because I liked to get into mischief. However, they underestimated the
power of God. He has sustained me and will continue to do so.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">One man
esteemeth one day above another (14:5a). Basically, men have esteemed
two days for worship: Sabbath day (the "seventh day," from sundown
Friday to sundown Saturday), and Sunday (the first day of the week).
Please note that the Sabbath doesn't fall on Sunday.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The Jews
and some churches observe the Sabbath as the holy day of the week.
Unfortunately, some of these churches condemn those who don't observe
the Sabbath. At one time the Seventh-day Adventist church taught that
worshiping on Sunday was the same as taking the mark of the beast and
anyone with the mark of the beast had no hope of salvation. So,
worshiping God on Sunday instead of on Saturday was condemning yourself
to hell. I'm so thankful that God is broader than the narrowness of
man. If our salvation was predicated on the concepts of man, none of us
would make it. (Fortunately, the Seventh-day Adventist church has since
modified its position.)
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The Book
of Acts records that Christians gathered to break bread on the first
day of the week, Sunday (Acts 20:7). Paul told the Corinthians to bring
their offerings together on the first day of the week (I Corinthians
16:2). Some of the early Church historians wrote about gathering to
worship on Sunday. For example, Tertullian noted that many believers
felt they should only break bread together on the first day of the week
because Christ arose on that day.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Many who
religiously observe the Sabbath claim that Sunday worship is linked
with the Babylonian corruption of the Church during the time of
Constantine. However, the practice of Sunday worship began long before
Constantine.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Another
esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own
mind (14:5b). Some people regard Sunday as a holy day and so refrain
from certain activities on that day. Others regard every day as a day
of worship, and to them Sunday isn't above another day.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Personally,
I consider every day alike. My wife wishes that I'd be more observant
of birthdays and anniversaries, but I esteem every day as the Lord's
day, and I do the Lord's business. I don't say, "Today is the Lord's
day and the rest of the week is mine." All my days belong to Him.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">He that
regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord (14:6a). If you regard
the Sabbath day, you're regarding it unto the Lord. And he that
regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it (14:6b). If
you don't regard a particular day, then you're regarding every day as
unto the Lord.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">He that
eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that
eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks (14:6c).
Whether we eat meat or abstain from meat and eat vegetables, we thank
God for our food.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For none
of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself (14:7). We all
have an influence on other people. We don't live in isolation chambers.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For
whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto
the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's. For to
this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord
both of the dead and living. But why dost thou judge thy brother? or
why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before
the judgment seat of Christ (14:8-10).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">We're not
to judge one another. To "set at nought thy brother" is to declare that
he isn't a Christian because of what he does. "He can't be a Christian
because he worships on Sunday instead of on the Sabbath." We shouldn't
judge our brothers, because one day we'll all stand before the judgment
seat of Christ. "We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ;
that every one may receive the things done in his body... whether it be
good or bad" (II Corinthians 5:10). As we stand before Jesus Christ to
be judged, the standard by which we'll be judged is the same we use to
judge others. He told us, "Judge not, that you be not judged. For with
what judgment you judge, you will be judged" (Matthew 7:1-2).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">A
Christian is never under any condemnation. "There is therefore now no
condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus" (Romans 8:1a). However,
several types of judgments are found in the Scriptures. There is the
believer's self-judgment. Paul tells us to examine ourselves when we
come to the Lord's table. "For if we would judge ourselves, we should
not be judged" (I Corinthians 11:31).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">There
will also be the judgment of the believer before the judgment seat of
Christ (14:10b). This is the bema seat, equivalent to the judge's seat
in the Olympic Games. After each game, the winners came before the
judge's seat to receive crowns for first, second, and third places.
Likewise, the Christian's works will be tested by fire, and he'll be
rewarded for those which remain. If the fire consumes all his works, he
won't receive a reward, but he'll be saved "yet so as by fire" (I
Corinthians 3:15). The judgment seat of Christ is only concerned with a
Christian's rewards and position in the kingdom, not with his
salvation.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The Lord
will judge our works by our motives. What motivates us to serve the
Lord? Are we looking for recognition from men? Jesus said, "Take heed
that ye do not your alms [acts of righteousness] before men, to be seen
of them" (Matthew 6:1a). If your motive is to be seen of man, then
Jesus said, "You have your reward" (Matthew 6:2). Unfortunately, the
praises of men are a powerful motivation, and much Christian work is
done for such psychological reasons.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For it is
written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and
every tongue shall confess to God (14:11). Paul also quotes this verse
from Isaiah 45:23 in Philippians. Christ emptied himself and was
"obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also
hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every
name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow...and that every
tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God
the Father" (Philippians 2:8b-11).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">So then
every one of us shall give account of himself to God (14:12). All will
give an account of themselves before God. I'll be responsible for the
things that I've done, and you'll be responsible for what you've done.
I won't account for you, nor will you account for me.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Let us
not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that
no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way
(14:13). We stumble a weaker brother by flaunting our freedom in Christ
before him. He may be emboldened to follow our example. Yet when he
does, he offends his own conscience and is thereby stumbled. Let's do
everything possible to avoid stumbling our brothers.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">I know,
and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of
itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is
unclean (14:14). That's a powerful statement. Paul knows that nothing
of itself is unclean. He could eat pork without any pangs of
conscience. Jesus said, "It isn't what goes into a man's mouth that
defiles a man" (Matthew 15:17-20).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Peter saw
a sheet come down from heaven with both clean and unclean animals. The
Lord said, "Rise, Peter. Kill and eat" He replied, "Lord, I've never
eaten any unclean food". Jesus said, "Don't call that unclean which I
have cleansed." This happened to Peter three times (Acts 10:9-16).
Though the main significance of the vision was that the Gospel would be
preached to the Gentiles, it also showed that nothing is unclean of
itself. All things are to "be received with thanksgiving" (I Timothy
4:4).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Still, if
I consider something to be unclean, then for me it is unclean. Why?
Because my relationship to God is based upon faith.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Many
things can hinder my faith, and one of the greatest hindrances is sin.
Satan uses my sins to accuse me, condemn me, and keep me from those
things God wants to give me. Satan points out my failures and
weaknesses, claiming that I'm worthless in God's sight. Since I've been
conditioned to believe that good boys are rewarded and bad boys are
punished, it's difficult to believe that God would bless me unless I
deserve it. Yet, God doesn't bless me on the basis of my goodness. He
blesses me on the basis of His grace and love for me.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">If I
believe something to be true, then to me it becomes true. If I believe
that God can't bless me because of my conduct, then I can't be blessed
of God. Unfortunately, some people regard God's blessings as approval
for all their actions, and that's dangerous. If God blesses me, He does
so on the basis of my belief in Him, and I'm receiving by faith. God
doesn't withhold His blessings from me every time I fail or stumble,
but neither do His blessings necessarily mean He approves of my
lifestyle.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Sadly,
there's been a great deal of preaching against so-called unclean
things. In some circles a person's salvation is questioned if he smokes
cigarettes. A Christian can smoke cigarettes or even cigars and not
affect his relationship with God in the least. Despite this truth, many
people are lost due to their cigarette habit. They've tried to give up
smoking, but failed. Because they've been taught that they can't be
Christians as long as they smoke, they don't believe that God has
washed and cleansed them from their sins. Thus, their belief becomes a
tragic reality.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">One day a
man came to me and said, "Chuck, I'd like to be a Christian. I believe
in God and I'd love to go to church. But I need a can of beer when I
get home. I work hard and it relaxes me." I asked him, "Who told you
that you couldn't have a can of beer?" This man had a conviction
against beer and considered it unclean. It kept him from true
fellowship with God and from attending church. The Lord doesn't demand
that we clean up our lives before coming to Him. He invites us to come
just as we are - ungodly, unrighteous sinners. He accepts us as we are,
then begins His work of transforming us into His image.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The Bible
teaches us to be moderate in all things, and there are limits to our
liberty. We shouldn't exercise our liberty so it brings us into
bondage. A fellow who needs beer just to relax isn't a free person,
even if a Christian. Anytime you're under the power of a thing, you're
no longer free. Some people are under the control of a sport, such a
surfing, water-skiing, or tennis. They go out to surf, but if the waves
are small their day is ruined. Instead, I say, "Praise the Lord! Let's
go jogging!" I love my freedom in Jesus Christ, and I wouldn't trade it
for anything.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">But if
thy brother be grieved with thy meat [freedom], now walkest thou not
charitably. Destroy not him with your meat, for whom Christ died
(14:15). Paul gives us an important rule here. You have your freedom,
but don't exercise it in front of a weak brother and stumble him. The
work of Christ can be negated in an immature believer when you flaunt
your freedom before him.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Let not
then your good be evil spoken of (14:16). You're free to do many
things. However, others may not understand this and will speak evil of
you, because you're boasting of your liberty.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For the
kingdom of God is not meat and drink (14:17a). The kingdom of God isn't
a matter of what you can or cannot eat. Unfortunately, the rules of
eating and drinking have become a major issue of the kingdom. But the
kingdom of God is righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost
(14:17b). Christians who are hung up about eating and drinking are
roaming in the spiritual wilderness. They haven't entered the real
kingdom, the fullness of God's Spirit with His glorious peace and joy.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For he
that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved
of men (14:18). God accepts you and men approve of you when you walk in
the Spirit, filled with the peace and joy of God. Instead of stumbling
people, you're a blessing to them.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Let us
therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things
wherewith one may edify [build up] another (14:19). Let's do things
that bring us together as a body rather than divide us. Let's build up
one another in the faith, especially the weaker brethren.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For meat
destroy not the work of God (14:20a). Because you feel free to eat pork
chops, don't destroy the work of God in some sensitive fellow, such as
a Seventh-day Adventist who may be a vegetarian. He's also a Christian
and loves the Lord. Don't argue with him about eating meat.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">I have
some wonderful Seventh-day Adventist friends, including a dentist who
would take advantage of me. He'd get me in the chair, prop open my
mouth with hardware, and then talk to me. I listened because I had to.
I still respect his opinion and consider him a friend to this day. I
accept him as a Christian brother, though I don't share his views. I
expect to see him in heaven, but I think he'll be surprised to see me
there!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">All
things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with
offence (14:20b). You can do a right thing in a wrong way. Your action
may be all right, but you can do it offensively, and that is an act of
evil. You're destroying the work of Christ in a person instead of
building him up in love.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">It is
good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy
brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak (14:21). If certain
things offend or weaken my brother, I won't do them in front of him.
Christian love causes me to live with more restraint than my own
convictions demand. I gladly deny myself so as not to offend or stumble
a weaker brother.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Hast thou
faith [faith to eat meat without a guilty conscience]? have it to
thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that
thing which he alloweth (14:22). You're a happy man when your heart
doesn't condemn you. Liberty in Christ has set you free from all
bondage.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">And he
that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for
whatsoever is not of faith is sin (14:23). It's wrong to talk someone
out of his convictions. When a person is pressured to act against his
convictions, he feels condemned before God. His conscience will whip
him, and Satan will take full advantage of his feelings. He'll try to
make the weaker brother feel alienated from God. Be wary of becoming an
unwitting tool in Satan's hands by urging a brother to act against his
convictions. Let everyone serve God according to his own measure of
faith.

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">We then
that are strong [strong in the faith] ought to bear the infirmities of
the weak, and not to please ourselves (15:1). Your faith may be strong.
Great! Use it to hold up the weaker brothers, not to please yourself.
Your concern should always be to help others.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Let
everyone of us please his neighbor for his good to edification. For
even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches
of them that reproached thee fell on me (15:2-3). Christ took upon
Himself the reproaches aimed at God, because He didn't live to please
Himself. In like manner, we take upon ourselves the reproaches directed
against Christ. Many times we're reproached for being too narrow or
restrictive, because we seek to deny our flesh to walk after Christ.
Jesus set the example for us of living not to please ourselves. If we
seek in all things to please God, we'll never go wrong.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For
whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning,
that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope
(15:4). The Scriptures were written for our learning, so we would have
hope through their message of patience and comfort. Paul prayed for the
Ephesians that God would open their eyes of understanding, that they
might know the hope of their calling (Ephesians 1:18). If we only
understood all that God has in store for us in His eternal kingdom, we
would gladly sacrifice to deny our flesh now for the hope of that
glorious future with Him.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Now the
God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward
another according to Christ Jesus: that ye may with one mind and one
mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Wherefore
receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God
(15:5-7). We should strive for unity of mind and heart, receiving one
another and accepting our differences within the body of Christ.
Differences do exist, but they need not divide us into splinter groups.
We can accept one another in love, because Christ has received us all.
This accepting love marks true spiritual maturity.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Now I say
that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of
God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers (15:8). Jesus
ministered to the Jews, the "circumcision," to fulfill God's promises
to these people. When He first sent out His disciples, He said, "Don't
go into the cities of the Gentiles" (Matthew 10:5). When the Gentile
woman came to Jesus about her possessed daughter, He said, "I'm only
sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel" (Matthew 15:24). Christ
came to fulfill the promises God made to the Jewish nation.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">And that
the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For
this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy
name. And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people. And
again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.
And again Isaiah saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that
shall rise to reign over the Gentiles (15:9-12a). The prophet Isaiah
foretold that the Messiah would reign over the Gentiles.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Although
Jesus ministered to the Jews in fulfillment of the promises of God, He
opened the way for all to receive the forgiveness of their sins.
Through His death and resurrection, the Gentiles have been brought into
the mercies of God. In Him shall the Gentiles trust (15:12b).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Now the
God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing - this peace
comes by believing in the Lord - that ye may abound in hope, through
the power of the Holy Ghost (15:13). As Paul closes his letter, he
ministers with benedictions and prayers for his readers.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">And I
myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of
goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another
(15:14). The word "admonish" would better read "effectively minister"
or "competently instruct." As Christians, we should be ministering
God's truth to one another in love.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Nevertheless,
brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as
putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,
that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles,
ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles
might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost (15:15-16).
Paul speaks of his ministry to the Gentiles and his hope that their
offerings, praises, and worship through the Holy Spirit might be
acceptable to God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">I have
therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things
which pertain to God. For I will not dare to speak of any of those
things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles
obedient, by word and deed, through mighty signs and wonders, by the
power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem and round about into
Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ (15:17-19).
Paul's ministry to the Gentiles was confirmed through the signs and by
the power of the Holy Spirit.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The Jews
believed that a Gentile could only be saved by proselytizing and
becoming a Jew. The idea that God wanted to save the Gentiles was
inconceivable. However, the power of the Holy Spirit soon changed the
minds of the Hebrew Christians. When the church in Jerusalem gathered
together to discuss the Gentiles, Peter testified. "And as I began to
speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning" (Acts
11:15). The work of the Holy Spirit on the Gentiles proved that God
would save them, too (Acts 11:18).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Then Paul
testified of the miracles that God had worked upon the Gentiles. The
miracles confirmed that the Gentiles had received God's Word. Paul
speaks of "fully preaching" the Gospel of Christ among the Gentiles
(15:19), because it was accompanied by many signs and wonders by the
Holy Spirit. The miracles of healing in the early Church were signs to
the unbelievers confirming the truths declared by the followers of
Jesus Christ. Miracles weren't limited to the apostles, as they also
accompanied the ministries of Philip (Acts 8:6), Stephen (Acts 6:8),
and others.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Yea, so
have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I
should build upon another man's foundation (15:20). Commendably, Paul
didn't try to take over where someone else had started. He went to
preach the Gospel where it hadn't been heard yet. As a result, Paul
converted many people to Christ and discipled them. There were others
who would then follow him around and seek to turn the new believers
from Paul and his teaching. These men challenged Paul's apostleship and
taught their own pernicious doctrines. They wouldn't evangelize but fed
off the work of others. The same is true today. Many men go around with
a message for the Church, bringing their false doctrines to the
established body rather than going to the lost.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">But as it
is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that
have not heard shall understand. For which cause also I have been much
hindered from coming to you. But now having no more place in these
parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;
whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I
trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward
by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company (15:21-24).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul here
writes on a more familiar level to the Roman Christians, expressing his
personal desire to see them. At the time of this writing, Paul was
delivering a gift from the Gentile believers to the saints in
Jerusalem. He wasn't exactly sure about this visit to Jerusalem, for
the Holy Spirit was warning him that bonds and imprisonment awaited him
there (Acts 21:11).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Whether
or not Paul ever went to Spain is a matter of conjecture. Certain
legends tell of him preaching the Gospel in that land. These stories
have never been confirmed and may simply spring from verse 24 in Romans
15.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul did
journey to Rome as the result of his appeal to Caesar, when Festus was
seeking to use him as a political pawn. He arrived in Rome under guard,
but the believers in Rome came out to greet him. Paul had a powerful
and effective ministry there, even though a prisoner.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">But now I
go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints (15:25). Paul's ministry
included bringing an offering to the believers. For it hath pleased
them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the
poor saints which are at Jerusalem (15:26). The saints of Jerusalem,
who thought the Lord was coming back very soon, sold their possessions
and placed the money into one common fund. When the money ran out, they
were in a financial crisis. Paul took an offering among the Gentiles as
an example of their love for them. As a pastor of a Gentile
congregation, I find it thrilling to take offerings for the Jews in
Israel as a witness for Jesus Christ. How wonderful to shock these
people with our love for them and by not asking for anything in return.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">It hath
pleased them verily; and their debtors they are (15:27a). I don't know
by what standard the Gentiles owed the gift to the Jerusalem church,
yet Paul understood the situation that way.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For if
the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their
duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things (15:27b). When he
wrote to the Corinthians, Paul told them to minister to the physical
needs of their spiritual teachers. "For it is written in the law of
Moses, thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the
corn" (I Corinthians 9:9).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">When
therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I
will come by you [on my way] into Spain. And I am sure that, when I
come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the
gospel of Christ (15:28-29). Paul didn't realize that he'd soon enter
Rome as a prisoner, but he did know that he'd come in the fullness of
the Gospel of Christ. That's the only way Paul ever traveled!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Now I
beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the
love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to
God for me (15:30). Paul requests that the believers agonize and strive
in their prayers. The Greek word for "strive" in verse 30 is translated
"press" in Philippians: "I press towards the mark for the prize of the
high calling of God in Christ Jesus" (Philippians 3:14). Paul begs them
to pray strenuously and with perseverance for him. "Put everything
you've got into those prayers!"
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Ministers
need the prayers of their flocks. With Paul I urge you to strive in
your prayers for your pastors. We need your prayers and we thank God
for them. Pastors are sustained by the power of the Spirit through the
prayer support of their congregations.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">That I
may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judea; and that my
service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints; that
I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be
refreshed (15:31-32). Paul asked the Romans to pray for three things.
First, that he might be delivered from the unbelieving Jews. This
petition was answered in an unusual way. When Paul was in the temple in
Jerusalem, some of the Asian Jews reported that he had brought Gentiles
into the temple grounds and had been teaching against Moses. This
excited the crowd, and they grabbed Paul and sought to beat him to
death. The Roman guard rushed into the melee and rescued him (Acts
21:29-32). So, Paul was delivered from the unbelieving Jews.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The
second prayer request was answered when the church in Jerusalem
received his offering. His third request, to come to Rome, was
fulfilled, but not as Paul had anticipated.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen (15:33).

to a few of special interest.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">I commend
unto you Phoebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is
in Cenchrea (16:1). This word "servant" in the Greek means "deaconess".
The deacons and deaconesses of the early Church cared for the church's
material needs. Phoebe, a deaconess, carried Paul's letter to the Roman
believers. Paul calls her a "sister" and commends her to them, that ye
receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in
whatsoever business she has need of you: for she hath been a succourer
[helper] of many, and of myself also (16:2). Phoebe, a faithful sister
in Christ, helped Paul very much. Women have always played a great role
in the body of Christ.

Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus (16:3) Priscilla and
Aquila were tent-makers who had left Rome under the persecution of
Claudius (A.D. 41-54). Paul, also a tent-maker, met and worked with
them on his first visit to Corinth. The couple then moved from Corinth
to Ephesus. When Apollos came there to preach, they took him aside and
explained the Word of God more completely to him (Acts 18:26). They
also ministered with Paul in Ephesus. At the time of this epistle, they
were back in Rome.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Wherever
Priscilla and Aquila went they shared the Gospel. They were like the
Christian couples of today who move into a new neighborhood, open their
homes, and start Bible studies. So Paul says, Greet the church that is
in their house (16:5a). People gathered in their house to study the
Word of God. The Church of Jesus Christ can meet in a home, on a field,
or on board a ship. His Church is made up of people who love Him and
are united by His Spirit. It meets whenever Christians gather to study
the Word, praise the Lord, and edify one another.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Speaking
of Priscilla and Aquila, Paul said, Who have for my life laid down
their own necks; unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the
churches of the Gentiles (16:4). This husband and wife team proved to
be a real blessing to the Gentile churches. They must have been an
outstanding couple, and I look forward to meeting them in heaven.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul
continues to send more greetings. Salute Andronicus and Junia, my
kinsmen, and my fellow prisoners, who are of note among the apostles,
who also were in Christ before me (16:7). Since Junia is a feminine
name, there are two possible interpretations of this verse. (1) Junia
was known and respected by Peter and John, who were apostles before
Paul. (2) Junia was an apostle and, thus, there were women apostles in
the early Church. It's impossible to be dogmatic about either
interpretation, but the Greek language of the text appears to support
the latter.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The role
of women in the early Church was important. Many women today find fault
with Paul, because he told the women of Corinth to keep silent in
church (I Corinthians 14:34). Let's look at his statement in context.
Paul didn't say that women were never to speak in church. In an earlier
chapter he had given them instructions about prophesying and praying in
the church (I Corinthians 11).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Most of
the early churches started in synagogues, where men sat on one side and
women on the other. The Jews didn't allow men and women to sit together
during the services. Today, a wife can nudge her husband and ask, "What
does the pastor mean?" In Corinth a woman had to call across the room
to ask her husband about the sermon. So, Paul told the women to keep
silent and wait until they returned home to question their husbands.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul
esteemed women as highly as men. Here in Romans 16:7 he greets his
"kinsmen," including a woman, Junia, possibly a noted apostle in Christ
before him.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Salute
one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you
(16:16). When I visited a church in Rome a few years ago, the men
greeted me with a holy kiss. I thought it appropriate that the church
in Rome still greets the brethren with a holy kiss, as Paul instructed
here.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Now I
beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences
that are contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them
(16:17). We're to accept differences regarding diet, holy days, and
other such customs, but we must draw the line with important doctrines.
One of the greatest dangers within a church isn't the exercise of
liberty by believers, but the false doctrines brought in by deceivers.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">For they
that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and
by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple
(16:18). Through eloquent speeches, clever sayings, and novel ideas
these men deceive those who lack a proper understanding of the Word of
God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The
Church across the United States, especially among the charismatic
groups, has been recently divided by various damnable doctrines. These
include the doctrine of shepherding (in which a person must submit to
the authority of a "shepherd" who is responsible to God for him) and
the doctrine that Christians can be possessed by demons and must have
them cast out.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The
latest and most pernicious of all these false doctrines is that a
Christian's lack of health or wealth is a sign of his lack of faith.
This doctrine proclaims that it's never God's will for a believer to
suffer. This false concept receiving such a wide audience today didn't
come from God's Word but from Christian Science and Science of Mind.
They teach the same basic concept: what you say is what you'll get.
These doctrines have divided the body of Christ, and we're told to mark
those who spread them.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Referring
to the Christians in Rome, Paul continues, For your obedience [to the
Word and to Christ] is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on
your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and
simple concerning evil (16:19). Paul wants us to be wise in good things
and simple in evil things. Don't probe into the work of Satan or seek
understanding about witchcraft, the occult, or the evils of today. The
Lord warned His people in the Old Testament not to study how the
heathen worshiped their gods (Deuteronomy 12:30). Be ignorant of evil,
but be wise in the good, righteous, and wonderful truths of the Spirit.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">And the
God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly (16:20a). God
prophesied to Adam and Eve that the serpent (Satan) would bruise the
Messiah's heel, but the seed of the woman (the Messiah) would bruise
his head (Genesis 3:15). No doubt referring to that prophecy, Paul said
that God would "bruise Satan under your feet shortly." This event
hasn't happened yet. Satan still wields power on earth, walking about
as a roaring lion (I Peter 5:8). God will deal with him soon, and he'll
be bound and cast into the abyss. Take heart, because we're near that
time!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The grace
of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. Timotheus my workfellow,
and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you
(16:20b-21).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The
scribe to whom Paul dictated this letter gives his own greeting. I
Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord. Gaius mine
host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the chamberlain of
the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother. The grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen (16:22-24).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul
begins his final benediction to the church in Rome. Now to him that is
of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of
Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was
kept secret since the world began, but now is made manifest, and by the
scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the
everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:
to God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen
(16:25-27).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Paul
speaks of the "revelation of the mystery" (16:25). A mystery in
Scripture isn't a truth that was difficult to understand. Rather, it's
a truth that wasn't revealed by the Spirit until these latter days.
Paul speaks much of such mysteries in his Epistle to the Ephesians.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">I don't
believe that the Spirit is revealing any new mysteries today. God has
already given us His wonderful revelation of all that pertains to life
and godliness. We don't need new truths. We need new experience in the
truths God has made known in the Book of Romans and throughout His
eternal Word. Amen!

<p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">INTRODUCTION
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">The New
Testament is divided into three categories. The first contains the
Gospels, the first four books of the New Testament, which deal with the
life of Christ. Next is the Book of Acts, which continues Christ's
ministry through His apostles. The rest of the New Testament is made up
of epistles, which are concerned with matters of doctrine. Romans is
the first epistle. </font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">In
determining scriptural conduct for the Church, we use hermeneutics, or
scriptural interpretation, as our guide. If something was taught by
Christ, practiced in Acts, and taught in the Epistles, then we feel
that it can be properly practiced by the Church. </font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype"><br>
<a name="AX01"></a>
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Romans 1: THE LOST WORLD
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 1
"Servant" means "bondslave." The slave was completely at his master's
disposal. His one goal in life was to serve. 'Apostle' means "one who
is sent.' Paul was called to be an apostle and sent by the Holy Spirit
to witness to the Gentiles. 'Gospel' means "good news."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 2 The message of the Gospel was promised in the Old Testament.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 3 The name Jesus is the Greek word for Joshua, which in Hebrew means "Jehovah is salvation."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Christ is Greek for the Hebrew word "Messiah" which means "Anointed One." 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Jesus is His name, Christ is His distinction, and Lord is His title, signifying our relationship with Him.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Mary was a descendant of David, to whom God had made the promise that Messiah would come through him.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 7 All
those in the body of Christ are saints. After we experience the grace
of God and make our peace with Him, we can know the peace of God in
every situation.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 11 Paul's desire to go to Rome was to minister to the church there.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 14
'Barbarians" refers to those who couldn't speak Greek. They weren't
necessarily wild, coarse people as the name implies today.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 16 This verse speaks of the power of God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 17 This
verse speaks of the righteousness of God and introduces the theme of
this epistle: righteousness comes by faith, not by works.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 18
This verse speaks of the wrath of God. Ungodly means "not in the right
relationship with God.' Unrighteous means "not in the right
relationship with man. We cannot have the proper relationship with God
and have the wrong relationship with man. Holding the truth in
unrighteousness is believing that there is a God, yet living as though
He didn't exist.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 20 We can see God in His creation.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 21 I Thessalonians 5:18; Psalm 37:23; Romans 8:28.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 23 The idols which men create often look like grotesque forms of men and beasts.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 24-28
When men create their own god, they become like the god they serve and
rapidly degenerate. God gives them up to their own base desire.
Homosexuality is the result of moral depravity; people are not "born"
homosexuals but have been given up to their own lusts.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 29-31 Our society has sought to rule God out of its conscience and now evidences the evils of reprobate minds.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 32
Movies and television programs that glorify lying, cheating, stealing,
murder, and adultery can cause us to take pleasure in these sins and
make us guilty. </font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype"><br>
<a name="AX02"></a>
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Romans 2: GOD'S JUSTICE
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 2 God will not only judge a person's actions but also his motivations. He knows the truth about each of us.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 4
People mistake Goes mercy and long-suffering for weakness or
indifference to their sin and rebellion. God's goodness, not the threat
of judgment and hell, leads a man to repentance. </font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 6 We ask for God's mercy, not justice; for our sins deserve punishment. 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 11 God will judge us without regard to our nationality.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 12-15
We'll be judged according to the knowledge that we have. God has given
every man a conscience, so that he knows good and evil.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 17-29
Rituals will not save us if we're not walking according to God's will,
whether we're circumcised, baptized, or members of a church. Obedience
to God, not rituals, counts for salvation.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype"><br>

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">ROMANS 3: THE FREE GIFT
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 2 The Word of God was given to the Jews, who preserved the Scriptures with diligence and accuracy.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 3 Our belief in God doesn't add to Him, nor does our unbelief detract from Him.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 5 Since God has said that all men have sinned, some people say they sin to prove that God spoke the truth.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 7 Some people tell untrue stories to sway people's emotions and bring them to salvation, but this is wrong. 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 10-18 Every man is guilty before God. There's not one man who dares to stand before God in his own righteousness.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 20 No
man can be justified by keeping the Law. The Law was intended to show
us our sin, not to justify us. "Justified" means "just as if I never
did it."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 21-22
There was a righteousness apart from the Law that was spoken of in the
Old Testament. This righteousness was the justification through faith
in God's grace and mercy. Our salvation is based on God's faithfulness
rather than the variability of our goodness.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 23 We all have sinned, some more than others; but all of us have fallen short of the goal God has for us. 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 24-26 God has a righteous basis for our justification through the sacrifice of Jesus for our sins. T
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 27 All we have done to gain salvation is to believe in the salvation God provided for us.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 31 The
Law is established because it has done its work of showing us our sin
and driving us to the redemption we have in Jesus.

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Romans 4: ABRAHAM AND FAITH 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 1 What did Abraham discover?
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 2 Abraham didn't trust in his works to save him (Romans 7:18).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 3 God imputes righteousness to us when we believe Him.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 4-5 If
we try to approach God on the basis of our works, we nullify His grace.
When we have a right relationship with God, our natural response that
flows from our hearts is to do anything He wants us to. Our works are
thus motivated by love (II Corinthians 5:14).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 7 "Blessed" means "Oh, how happy!"
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 9-11 God considered Abraham righteous before he had ever been circumcised
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 13-14 Abraham was accounted righteous before the Law was ever given.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 15 There is no way to break a law before it exists.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 16 Our salvation is not variable, i.e., dependent on our works, but is as sure as God's promise to us.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 17 God talked about Abraham's son as if Isaac existed before he was even conceived. 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 18-21 The four keys to Abraham's faith:
<br>(1) Abraham ignored the human possibilities and trusted to God to keep His promises (Isaiah 55:8, 9).
<br>(2) Abraham did not stagger at the promises of God (Philippians 4:19). 
<br>(3) Abraham praised God before the evidence was there. 
<br>(4) Abraham believed God was able to do what He had said He would (Isaiah 40:15; Ephesians 3:20).

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Romans 5: JUST AS IF I NEVER DID IT
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 2 We
have access to the Father any time our righteousness is based on faith.
When our righteousness is based on our keeping the Law, access to the
Father depends on our works. </font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 3 The trials that come into our lives promote spiritual growth.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 6-8 Christ died for sinners, not "righteous" people (Mark 2:17).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 9-10
Christ died for us when we were sinners and reconciled us to God. Now
He establishes our relationship with God through His life.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 11 The
word 'atonement' in the Old Testament meant "covering." The blood of
the sacrifice covered the sins of the people, but it couldn't put away
their sins. In the New Testament, 'atonement" means "at one-ment,"
because Christ's death put away our sins and made us one with Him.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 12-14 When Adam sinned he brought sin into the world, and every man after him was born a sinner.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 15 One man brought sin into the world, and one Man died for the forgiveness of the world's sins.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 18 Adam's sin brought condemnation on us; Christ's death bought justification for us.

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">ROMANS 6: VICTORY OVER SIN
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 2 "God
forbid!' means "perish the thought." When we're born again, our spirits
are put in control of our bodies and minds. In the spiritual dimension,
we fellowship with God and are conscious of Him.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 3-4 We buried the old flesh-dominated nature in baptism, and the new creature is free from sin. 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 6
"Destroyed" is katargeo which means "to put out of business." This
should read in the past tense, "Our old man was crucified." </font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 11
God didn't intend for our bodily appetites to rule over us, but, as
long as we're in these bodies, we'll have a struggle with the flesh. We
must daily go before God to reckon our old nature dead and by faith to
claim the victory (Galatians 5). </font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 12-13 We don't have to sin anymore. We now have the choice to yield to the flesh or to God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 14-17
We've been freed from being servants of sin. Now that we're free from
the bondage of sin and are under grace, it doesn't make sense to sin.
Instead, we can yield ourselves to God as instruments for
righteousness.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 21 The fruit (or product) of sin is death.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 22-23 The fruit of holiness is eternal life.

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Romans 7: FLESH VS. SPIRIT
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 1 When
Paul uses the word "brethren" he's referring to his Jewish brothers.
The principle Paul begins to establish here is that death brings
freedom from the Law.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 4-6
The Jews who had become Christians thought they still had to keep the
Law. So, Paul explained that they had died in Christ. Once freed from
the Law, we can serve God from the motivation of love.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 7 Paul here states that the purpose of the Law was to show men their sins. 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 14
We're in agreement with the Law because it is good and just. Our
problem is that the Law is spiritual we are carnal. Jesus explained
God's intention when He gave the Law, because the Pharisees had
misinterpreted it (Matthew 5-7) The New Covenant we have with God
depends upon our belief in His righteousness. The Old Covenant depended
on our righteousness in keeping the Law. </font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 15 This is the struggle Paul had before he realized that the Law was spiritual.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 17-20
Only the Christian has this conflict between the flesh and the spirit.
The non-Christian lives in harmony with the desires of his flesh, but
we Christians are trying to bring our flesh into conformity with the
will of God. Now our will and desire is to serve God. So, when we sin,
it's because we still have the sinful nature.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 22 My spiritual, inward self loves God's law and wants above all to obey Him. 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 23 Our flesh always seeks to gratify itself and struggles with our spirit to bring it under the control of sin.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 24 We're dragging the body of our dead man (our flesh) around with us, hoping for the day when we'll be released.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 25 With God's help through Jesus, there's a way that we don't have to continue to be defeated by the flesh.

<a name="AX08"></a>
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Romans 8: SET FREE!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 1 Because in our hearts we desire to serve God, He doesn't condemn us when we fail.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 2 The law of sin and death is still in effect, but the new law of life in Christ Jesus supersedes the old Law. 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 3-4 The
law of sin and death couldn't make us righteous, but the new law of
life is fulfilled in us by Christ (not by us) as we walk after the
Spirit. Through Him we're accounted righteous.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 5 The main concerns of the flesh are: What shall we is eat? What shall we drink? What shall we wear?
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 6 The
mind of the flesh is death; the mind of the Spirit is life and peace.
As we allow the Spirit to govern our minds, we think in conformity to
the will of God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 7-8 The flesh is in rebellion to Gods laws, so we cannot please God as long as we're in the flesh.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 9 We're not in the flesh when we allow God's Spirit to dwell in us.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 11 The Holy Spirit brings us into the resurrected life of Christ.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 12 We don't owe the flesh anything!
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 13 Through the power of the Spirit, we're enabled to put to death the deeds of the flesh.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 15 "Abba" means "father."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 17 Matthew 25:34.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 18 II Corinthians 4:17.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 19 All
of creation waits expectantly for the redemption of our bodies when
we'll finally be in a body that is in harmony with our spirit.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 20 "Vanity" means "emptiness."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 23 "They" refers to the world around us.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 24-25 Our hope is for that new body from God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 26-27
"Infirmities" means "weaknesses." The purpose of prayer is never to get
our will done, but to get God's will done. It's a waste of time to pray
for things that are contrary to God's will. Sometimes, we don't know
God's will in a certain situation; then the Holy Spirit interprets our
groanings and intercedes with God for us, according to God's will.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 28 This beautiful verse sustains us in times of painful trials.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 29 God
predestined those He knew would respond to His love and grace. When God
watches our lives, it's as if He were watching a rerun, because He
knows what we will do (Psalm 90:9). Christ was the firstborn.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 30-31
God chose us, called us, justified us, and glorified us. He is for us.
The world, the flesh, and the devil are against us, but they're no
match for God.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 33 Satan accuses us, but God justifies us. 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 34 The
difference between Satan's condemnation and the Holy Spirit's
conviction is that the condemnation makes us want to pull away from
God, because we feel unworthy; while the conviction makes us want to go
to God to make things right. Jesus doesn't want to condemn us. He
pleads our case for us.

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Romans 9: CHOSEN
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 1-3 Paul continually sorrowed that the Jews didn't accept Jesus as the Messiah. 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 4 God
adopted the children of Israel as His special people. The glory of
God's presence filled the tabernacle and the temple. God made a
covenant with the people that He would be their God and they would be
His people. God gave the Law and the order for service to Him
(Leviticus). God gave numerous promises to Israel, some that are still
in effect today.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 5 The great patriarches belonged to Israel.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">This text should read "...Christ came, who is God over in all, blessed forever." Jesus is God (Titus 2:13).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 6-9 Paul here demonstrates that not all of the children of Israel were acknowledged by God as His people.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 10-13 God had chosen Jacob, because He knew that Jacob would be a spiritual man and Esau would be a fleshly man.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 14 The choices God has made haven't closed the door to one individual. He loves and accepts all who come to Him.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 15-18 Since God is supreme, He can choose and act as He pleases. His ways are beyond our human understanding. 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 24 God has called us (the Church) out from among the Jews and Gentiles that He might display His mercy and through us.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 27 Only a remnant of Israel will be saved, so being we Jewish doesn't guarantee salvation.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 30 The Gentiles, who didn't follow the Law, gained righteousness through faith. 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 31-33
Jesus was the stumbling stone. The idea of righteousness by faith was
difficult for the Jews to accept after the years they'd spent seeking
righteousness by the Law.

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">Romans 10: SAVED 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 1-3
Paul wasn't bitter against the Jews for fighting his the attempts to
bring Christ to them. He was longing to release them from their futile
attempts to become righteous by following the Law.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 4 Christ brings an end to the Law for those who believe. 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 5 The righteousness of the Law is based on man's doing; the righteousness of faith is based on the work Christ has done. 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 8-10 We only have to speak the words of faith in Jesus to attain all His righteousness.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 11-13
God delights to show mercy and will not turn away any who come to Him.
He doesn't take more pleasure in a Jew coming to salvation than a
Gentile.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 14-15 This passage contains the reason we send missionaries out.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 17 This 'word" refers to the spoken word.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 18 Psalm 19:4. Nature testifies to God's existence.

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 1-4 God hasn't cast off Israel. He defended them when Elijah complained to Him.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 5 God has a remnant among the Jews today who believe in Jesus as their Messiah.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 6 We're accepted by God either by our works or by grace; it cannot be both.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 7-8 God has blinded those who reject His grace.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 11 Through the cutting off of the Jews, an opening was made for the Gentiles.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 12 When God restores the Jews to His favor, the Kingdom Age will begin.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 17 The
Gentiles are the wild olive tree grafted into the good olive tree of
the Jews, with the blessings of the covenant and the promises.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 20-21 God grafted us by our faith in Christ. The Jews were cut off because of their unbelief, not merely to make room for us.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 25 The
"fullness of the Gentiles" indicates that there are a number of
Gentiles who will be saved, after which God will turn back to Israel,
drawing His people unto Himself.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 28 God calls the Jews His "elect' (Matthew 24). 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 32 The Jews are now in unbelief of God, so that He can extend His mercy to them.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 33 God
doesn't ask us to reconcile the various truths about His relations with
man. He only wants us to believe, trusting Him with simple faith.

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 1 "Reasonable" means "logical". It makes sense to let God direct our lives.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 2 God leads us in very natural ways when we make ourselves available to Him.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 3 I Corinthians 4:7; Ephesians 2:8-9.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 6 God gives us a gift suitable for our ministry in the body.

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 9 Show love without partiality; love all equally. 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 10-21 These verses are exhortations from Paul on the the way we should live as Christians.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 20
Heaping coals of fire on someone's head refers to the fact that people
often carried coals in packs on their backs and were given live coals
by friends. It was a gracious act.

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 3-4
People who obey the law need not fear the police. They're here to
protect us, and we should have an appreciative attitude toward them.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 6-7 "Tribute" means "taxes."
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 8-10 Love for one another sums up the Law and makes it a positive command, rather than a list of negatives.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 13 This verse names the works of darkness we're to cast off.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 14 This verse tells us that the armor of light is Jesus Christ.

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 1 We shouldn't judge those who are weak in faith but accept them with love.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 2-3 Paul here talks of vegetarians who were weak in the faith because they felt convicted about eating meat.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 5-6 Others who were weak in the faith felt that there were certain days when the Lord should be worshipped
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 7 Paul
encouraged the Christians to allow each other their personal
convictions without trying to put them on every one else. </font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 10 To "set at nought" a brother is to say that he isn't a Christian.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 11-12
When we stand before God for judgment, it won't be to determine our
salvation, for that is already secure. He'll judge our works and the
motivation be hind our works, then give us our place in His Kingdom
(Philippians 2:10, 11).
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 13-15 Paul here warns against enjoying our freedom in Christ to the detriment of our weaker fellow-Christians. 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 18 God accepts us and men approve us if we're walking in the Spirit.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 20 We
shouldn't destroy the work of God in a persons life because we disagree
about eating meat. We can do something that isn't wrong in itself but
is evil because it offends someone else.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 22-23
It's wrong to try to argue someone out of his convictions, because his

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 5-7 We should seek unity in the body, accepting one another.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 8 Jesus ministered to the Jews, the "circumcision,' because He came to fulfill God's promises to the Jews.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 9-12 Paul gives the Scriptures that prophesied the inclusion of the Gentiles in God's grace.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 13 Paul here begins an extended benediction and series of prayers to close the epistle.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 16-19 Paul says his ministry to the Gentiles was proper because the Holy Spirit ordained it.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 22-24 Paul hadn't visited the church in Rome before.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 26 The saints in Jerusalem were poor, because they in had sold their possessions to share everything in common.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 30 Paul asked the Christians to strive and persevere in their prayers for him - important words relating to prayer.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 31-32
Paul asked them to pray for three things: (1) that he be delivered from
the unbelievers in Judea, (2) that the offering would be accepted by
the Jerusalem church, (3) that he could visit Rome with joy and be
refreshed. </font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype"><br>

Paul met Priscilla and Aquila when he first went to Corinth. Wherever
they lived, they opened their home for Bible studies and helped to
establish new believers.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 7 Junia is a feminine name. Apparently, there were women apostles.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 17-18
Differences over doctrinal matters were too dangerous to overlook. Paul
warns the Christians to take note of those who brought divisions into
the Church and to avoid them.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 19
Their obedience to Christ was well-known. Paul wanted the Christians to
be wise in spiritual things but unlearned in evil things.

</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Frutiger Linotype">v. 25 "Mystery" refers to something now revealed that had previously been unknown, not something that couldn't be known.
