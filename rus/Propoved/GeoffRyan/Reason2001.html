necessary to you, then forget the journey. You will
never make it, for this is a journey of unknowables – of

(Madame Jean Guyon)<br><br>
‘The question of why evil exists is not a theological
question, for it assumes that it is possible to go behind
the existence forced upon us as sinners. If we could
answer it then we would not be sinners. We could make
something else responsible. Therefore the “question
of why” can always only be answered with the “that”
which burdens man completely.’ (Dietrich Bonhoeffer,
Creation and Fall / Temptation )

<td>Fatima was three years old - a year older
than my daughter, a year younger than my
youngest son. She had two days to live. She
lay in the middle of a hospital bed, arms and
legs straight like a stick figure, wrapped in blood-stained
gauze to cover the burns on 70% of her body. Her face
was burned too. Tubes snaked out of her nostrils. The
only movement, the only sign of life, came from her eyes.
They were wide open and followed me as I moved around
the room, large and brown and wet. Her breath came in
short gasps as drawn out breaths caused too much pain.
<br><br>
Fatima was a Chechen and she died in that hospital
bed in the city of Nazran in the Muslim Republic of
Ingushetia, Southern Russia. The Second Chechen
War, as it is becoming known, is a brutal conflict with a
history behind it stretching back several hundred years.
It is a particularly nasty example of the religio-ethnic,
semi-nationalistic ‘peoples war’ that have characterized
the declining years of the 20th century. ‘There is no one to
root for in this mess of a war’ wrote Colin McMahon of
the Chicago Tribune. He is dead right.
<br><br>
Fatima was in the kitchen of her house in a small
village in the Chechen interior when a flying piece of
shrapnel from a rocket exploded into the hot water tank
spewing boiling water all over her. At the border crossing
into Ingushetia, the soldiers would not let her mother
cross with her for three days. During those days, winter
days, she lay in the open air, on the side of the road,
with her open burns. By the time they were permitted
to cross and made it to the hospital in Nazran, it was far
too late.
<br><br>
As the nurses changed the bandages for the last time
on the day she died, silent tears flowed out of Fatima’s
eyes to stain her pillow. She never complained and died
with her eyes open, they simply stopped blinking, stopped
watching, stopped seeing. One final, painful breath.
I fled the hospital that day and stood outside gulping
in the fresh air on the street. I breathed in huge drawn-
out breaths to compensate for what Fatima wanted to do,
but could not. My project manager for the relief effort we
are running in Ingushetia and Chechnya, was quiet and
tense. He is a Chechen, a Muslim, a refugee like Fatima.
<br><br>
‘I have a daughter her age’, he stated. I knew his story and
knew that he has, in fact, five daughters. At the beginning
of our acquaintance I foolishly asked, ‘no sons?’, knowing
how important sons are in the patriarchal Chechen
culture. ‘I had two sons’, he replied stonily. ‘Twins, both
1 1⁄2 years old. During the first war* they were hiding in
our basement with their grandmother during an attack. A
trooper threw a grenade into the basement.’
<br><br>
I can still see Fatima’s small face at night sometimes.
Bright child eyes - much like my daughter’s. I can hear
the short, sharp struggling gasps of air. I can smell the
presence of death in the hospital room. I can see her
mother slumped in the corner of the room, unblinking
with Islamic resignation: ‘If Allah wills...’. I think of the
soldiers in the planes who bombed the village and the
ones at the checkpoint who rejected the small amount
of money that Fatima’s mother offered them as a bribe.
How much is the life of a three-year old worth? Does the
price go up in a war zone? I imagine what I would do to
them if I could get my hands on them.
<br><br>
In spite of my theological training, in spite of myself,
I could easily wonder where God was. I do not allow
myself to. I never said a word further to my manager
about this. We were silent together. He as a fatalistic
Muslim. Me - a realist who has made a deal with God.<br>
* (1994-1996)
<br><br>
*****
<br><br>
I am 38-years old, have lived in three different
countries and have seen something of life. For the past
nine years I have lived in Russia. I am a Captain in The
Salvation Army and am presently responsible for all Army
operations in nine cities in the south of Russia.
Since arriving in this land, a month before the coup
that ended Communism, I have changed much, learnt
much. As one writer has noted, Russia marks people.
Some it makes exquisite, others it cripples.
<br><br>
I like to think of myself as a realist and as such, have
come to a firm realization, a firm conviction, on three
matters. I have ‘worked them out’ over the years of my life
to date, in a hundred engagements with the enemy, with
much ‘fear and trembling’ as required by the Scriptures.
The first conviction is this: Not every problem has a
solution. The second one is: Life is not fair. The third
one is with regard to the existence of evil in the world:
The question is not to ask ‘why?’, but rather – ‘what
now?’ There is no point on speculating why it exists and
why God allows it. Far better to acknowledge the facts
before one and deal with these.
<br><br>
These are more than convictions of mine, to me they
are proven facts - slow in coming but steadily forged over
years as a soldier in the fight of faith. They cannot be
disproved to me. They form a paradigm that allows me
to fight the battles God has sent me into. They allow
me to survive, to get through the night. Bear with me
as I continue the retelling of three encounters of recent
months by way of explanation.
<br><br>

<br><br>
‘I’m afraid to say it...to say what I am really
thinking.’
<br><br>
It was quiet and warm in the car and snow was falling
outside. Tears formed in the corners of her large eyes as
she bowed her head and stared unseeing into her lap.
I have known Natasha for almost nine years now,
starting from the time she wandered into one of our first
meetings in the city then known as Leningrad, now called
St. Petersburg. It was early autumn 1991. She got saved,
joined the corps, became a soldier, eventually working
fulltime for the Salvation Army. She was eighteen then.
<br>
Born and raised in Kazakhstan in Central Asia, at
seventeen Natasha left home to become an actress. She
did not make the stage, instead she found us. In 1994,
Natasha moved south to Rostov-on-Don as part of a
team assisting my wife and myself as we pioneered in the
region.
<br><br>
Three days after arriving in Rostov, Natasha received a
call from home - her Father had died of alcohol poisoning.
She went home to bury him and then returned to us. The
other team members went back north after a year while
Natasha stayed.
<br><br>
I have never met anyone with a gift for working with
children like Natasha. She can work magic with them,
becoming one with their world yet remaining apart,
moving easily in and out and never really belonging in
either. Now aged 28, she remains to me the most perplexing
combination of childish innocence and worldly guile.
She exudes simplicity yet at times comes out with the
most profound thoughts. She needs people, an audience
- yet is almost painfully shy. She remains alone in the
biggest crowd and her dazzling smile is marred only by
the sadness in her eyes. She is an enigma. She is also now
an orphan
<br><br>
In September the rest of her family died - her elderly
mother, her older brother and his wife. Wiped out in one
afternoon by a man as yet free. If Americans choose to
kill mainly with guns - Russians use knives, and Natasha’s
family died a Russian death with no clear motive, blood
splattered walls and lingering agony in the ill-equipped
emergency ward of the local hospital.
<br><br>
At the time of our conversation, Natasha had just
returned from burying the rest of her family.
<br><br>
‘I think I hate God’, she continued. I had noticed
that during meetings she did not sing anymore and that
her eyes remain open and staring during prayer.
<br><br>
‘I can’t sing, I can’t pray, I can’t even think of God
without...’
<br>
The inevitable ‘why’ remained unspoken, but
everywhere present.
<br><br>
She had a point. Since consecrating her life to God
almost a decade before she had served faithfully, doing
what we asked of her, going where we wanted - a gypsy life
with no real fixed abode in often difficult places, working
long hours, minimal pay. ‘No personal life whatsoever’ was
one of her habitual sayings, said only half-jokingly. ‘...
what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love
mercy and to walk humbly with your God.’ What more?
Why then?
<br><br>
Her mother would visit from time to time - a simple
soul, a nice lady, benign. Not asking much from life and
never having received much. She believed in God, as all
women her age in Russia seem to nowadays. She smiled
much, like her daughter. I remember her singing a folk
song one night during a campfire at one of our summer
camps. ‘My mother was believer’, Natasha whispered, ‘but
my brother...’ The tears came again.
<br><br>
Very briefly I considered defending God by explaining
the complicated relationship between free will, the
sovereignty of God and the terrible implications of God’s
refusal to win by coercion and thus the sin within and
the evil around. My heart was not in it. It would not have
helped.
<br><br>
I wanted to hold her close, comfort her and tell her
that I would look after her and that nothing bad would
ever happen again. This would have been a lie, though,
and was not appropriate in any case. So I bought her an
ice cream, assured her that the culprit would receive his
punishment (if not here, then in the hereafter). ‘Nothing
will change what has happened’, I said, ‘the issue now is not
why, but what next?’
<br><br>
I offered my help in a practical manner with the legal
details. We talked no further about God.
<br><br>
*****
<br><br>
Olga is not the type to ‘rage, rage against the dying of
the light’, though I would if I were her. She is placid by
nature, docile some would say, certainly calm and quiet.
Maybe things like this happen to people like her because
of this, because she lets them happen. Who can tell?
She is 21 now and came to us after having made
contact with our HIV/AIDs, Drug & Alcohol Rehab
Program. She came for counseling. She was eighteen.<br>
Her live-in boyfriend was an addict and infected her in
bed. Olga became HIV positive. The counseling helped
and she started attending church.
<br><br>
She got saved, became a soldier, left her job selling in
the local market, took discipleship training with another
Christian agency in the city then entered our own mission
training program. She changed from an emotional flatliner
to a smiling, cheerful follower of Jesus. ‘I can’t believe how
I lived before,’ she said, ‘I feel like it was all only a dream
and only now have I woken up to life!’
<br><br>
One night Olga’s old boyfriend came calling, one
thing led to another - he raped her. She became pregnant.
Her grandmother insisted she get an abortion - she
refused as a Christian. We suggested she put the child up
for adoption - she refused as a mother. The church council
allowed her to remain as a member in good standing. She
had done nothing wrong, nothing at all.
<br><br>
The boyfriend now attends Sunday services, his
motives unclear. I shake his hand resentfully, not wanting
to meet his gaze lest he read in my eyes what I truly think
of him. How could he? How could God let him ruin it
all - everything was going great. Olga finally, for the first
time in her short twenty years had the chance at life. She
had taken hold of hope and was fashioning a future. All
now ripped out and stamped out like a cigarette butt in
a ten-minute scuffle in a dingy apartment on an autumn
evening. The dream turned into a nightmare.
<br><br>
Olga has stopped smiling these days. She is due in
the next month. How long will she live? Will her child be
HIV positive? Where does the boyfriend fit in? Olga does
not ask these questions, she is too placid, too resigned.
She simply does not smile anymore.
<br><br>
I could rage for her, it is in me - this is beyond unfair,
a no-win situation for everyone, no answers in sight. But I
do not rage. I shake my head and move on. I am a soldier,
I know there is little point in lingering over a casualty.
The medics have been called. There is nothing more for
me to do here.
<br><br>
*****
<br><br>
As a Westerner and therefore a child of the
enlightenment, I am a product of rationalism. As a
Protestant I am therefore uncomfortable with mystery.
Every question has an answer, every problem a solution,
there is always a way to figure things out and satisfy the
need to know. We were given this understanding with our
mother’s milk.
<br><br>
But nine years in Russia, close engagement with the
Eastern Orthodox tradition and with a nation whose
thinking patterns are more Eastern than Western and
who are therefore comfortable with mystery – all this has
has an effect. I have changed, I think differently now.
<br><br>
Somewhere along the journey I stopped trying to
figure out how evil came into the world; why God allows
little children to suffer; why life is so unfair to some and
so generous to others. I stopped asking why? To wonder
why is a luxury it turns out, one that I indulged in when
I had the time and space, when I could turn the problem
over at arm’s length, rationally and objectively weigh all
sides of the issue, when it mainly only theory that I had
experienced. Then I wondered ‘why?’ and I wondered
much about it. That was a long time ago.
<br><br>
Theory gave way to experience, to reality, and I
found things different on the battlefield, with the enemy
pressing hard and the ground slick with blood; when
you are bone-tired with the fear that has been throbbing
through your veins so fast for so long that it seems you
will split open; when the stench of sin and evil and pain
clogs your nostril and invades your lungs. When this
happens, you could care less ‘why’ this is all happening.
You are in the middle of the ‘what now?’ and there is
no other reality. To think otherwise would be fatal, the
enemy waits for such an opening. So you follow orders,
parry and thrust and slash and leave the philosophers to
contemplate ‘why?’
<br><br>
And so I compromised and made a deal with God.
I would no longer ask ‘why?’ I would live with mystery
and paradox and a hundred unanswered questions and
unsolvable problems. I would forget my upbringing and
my heritage and learn my lessons from the long-suffering
Slavs among whom God has sent me to live and work.
<br><br>
I would put aside my ruminations and work with the
‘what now?’ I would fight evil and unrighteousness with
all my might and save as much of the world as I could. I
would focus and not allow any distractions, any luxuries,
I would no longer ask ‘why?’
<br><br>
“Theirs is not to reason why, there’s but to do and die”,
wrote Tenneyson . And I have died a hundred deaths since
I made that deal - in hospital rooms, bedsides, darkened
cars, back alleys and lately amid the carnage of war. But
I have not gone back on my deal. I have fought and will
continue to fight, to the very end.
<br><br>
When all is finished for me, however. When I have
fought the food fight to the end and I stand before
the Lord, bloody and scarred no doubt, but hopefully
unbowed. Then I will ask of God to keep His end of the
bargain.
<br><br>
I will talk about Natasha and Fatima and Olga and
the hundreds and hundreds of others - and I will want
some answers.
<br><br>
I will ask ‘why?’ I will scream it out until it fills the
heavens and shakes the earth. I will deafen the angels with
my ‘WHY?’
<br><br>
Where was I when He laid the earth’s foundations?
Where was He when Fatima was shivering on the
ground as the infection spread through her body?
I really do not think that it will come to this, however.
God is good, He keeps His promises. After all, we made
a deal.
