<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christmas is a time when we celebrate a joyful story of
a great birth, but it is also a time when you hear sad stories that seem all the sadder because
they happen near Christmas.  <br>Many of them involve children.  This is one of them.  Johnny
was born to parents who never seemed to have the kind of relationship with their son that many
other people manage to enjoy.  <br>They were very religious people, and quite strict.  I don't
know a lot about his relationship with his parents, but I think they were out of his life when
he was just a very young man.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was a loner, some
might say a hermit, who lived by himself in a lonely rural area.  He never married and had no
children.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was unemployed as far as anyone knew and
scraped together what meals he could find.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was a
bit of a wild man who was always saying wild things to people who passed by-many thought him to
be mentally unstable-and he had no use for society.  <br>Local religious leaders tried to
connect with him but he had no time for them.  By the time he reached his early 30's he was
already in prison and his life went down from there.  As if to sum up his sad life, he died
young in a violent death.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When Johnny was born, as people gazed at his little tiny fingers and face, and fussed over him,
coo-cooing over this young life so full of potential and promise, the thought "I wonder what he
will become?" was on everyone's mind.  Those are the kind of things you ask when a baby is
born.  What would he accomplish in his life?  People waited to see what Johnny would amount to,
waited almost 3 decades to see what he would become.  Looking back, his life seemed so hard,
lonely, short and tragic.  On the other hand though, Jesus said he was the greatest man that
ever lived.  We know him as John the Baptist.

<td>We read the story of his birth in Luke 1:57-66.   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	57 When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	58 Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they
shared her joy.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 59 On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after
his father Zechariah,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
60 but his mother spoke up and said, "No! He is to be called John."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 61They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who has that name."

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 62 Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 63 He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone's astonishment he wrote, "His name is
John."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 64 Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue was loosed, and he began to speak, praising
God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 65 The neighbors were all filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea people
were talking about all these things.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
66 Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, "What then is this child going to be?"
For the Lord's hand was with him.

					When it was time for Elizabeth's baby to be born, she
gave birth to a son.  And when her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had been very
merciful to her, everyone rejoiced with her.
When the baby was eight days old, they all came for the circumcision ceremony. They wanted to
name him Zechariah, after his father.  But Elizabeth said, "No! His name is John!"
					"What?" they exclaimed. "There is no one in all your
family by that name."  So they used gestures to ask the baby's father what he wanted to name
him.  He motioned for a writing tablet, and to everyone's surprise he wrote, "His name is
John."  Instantly Zechariah could speak again, and he began praising God.  		Awe
fell upon the whole neighborhood, and the news of what had happened spread throughout the
Judean hills.  Everyone who heard about it reflected on these events and asked, "What will this
child turn out to be?" For the hand of the Lord was surely upon him in a special way.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The birth stories of Jesus and John the Baptist are intertwined in the first two chapters of
Luke.

<td>We read first of the angel Gabriel's announcement to John the Baptist's father old
Zechariah that he will have a son and he is to call him John and then John is conceived.  Then
Gabriel announces to the virgin Mary that she will have a son and she is to call him Jesus.
Jesus is conceived within the overshadowing presence of the Holy Spirit.  Then John is born and
named and circumcised and then we will Jesus is born and named and circumcised.  The responses
of people to these two babies is recorded too.
When the baby boy was born to Zechariah and Elizabeth, there were happy people all around
because after so many years of the social stigma of being childless Elizabeth finally had a
baby!  When the baby was eight days old the time came for him to be circumcised.  One of the
orders of the day was the official naming of the baby.  There was a big kafuffle about it.
Everyone who was gathered there were ready to call him Zechariah after his father.  Means "the
LORD has remembered."  Pretty appropriate.  Zechariah Jr.  Zachary.  Zach for short.  Actually
Zachary is a pretty trendy name right now.  We do that, naming sons after fathers. I am named
after my father.  Maybe some of you were named after someone in your extended family.  "Excuse
me", Elizabeth cut in, "we're going to call him John."  "John?  Where does John come from?
Nobody in your family has that name!"
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Maybe some people suggested a compromise - Zee-Jay.  Zechariah John.  I have a nephew named TJ.
 Gestured to Zechariah - had been unable to talk since the angel told him he would have a son
because he didn't believe him.  Writing tablet scratched into the wax surface "His name is
John."   John means "the LORD is gracious."  Also very appropriate!  And as soon as he wrote
"His name is John" his voice was given back to him and he began to raise the roof with praise
to God.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And for days afterwards, nobody talked or thought of anything else in all the hill country of
those parts but the little boy, whose name enabled his father to speak again.  What will become
of this child?  The hand of God is on him.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Three significant things here I would like to work with:  the name "John," the question "What
will he become?" and the intertwining of the two stories.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let's think about names.  All throughout the Bible names are important.  The word "name"
appears 933 times in Bible.  Add the word "called" and the number is way over 1000.   People
had their names changed for important reasons.  Even late names are used.  Jesus called Peter
"Simon Barjonah" (Son of John - we would call him Simon Johnson).  The naming of children has
always been a very important event.  Our names are important.  I have been really  encouraged
in this as I have looked for God's grace in my name.  David means "beloved."  Recently I found
that "Bield" an old Scottish word means shelter.  One of the ways this word was used was as a
shelter for sheep, a sheep fold.  As a pastor this has been a good gift from God to me-a
beloved sheepfold.  I encourage you to look for God's grace in your name.  I will help you if I
can.  Go over the meanings of the names of your children.  Was God involved in your naming?
Was God superintending the event when you were named?  Was it significant to him?  If you
brought your name to God what could he do with it?  I invite you to think about this.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now let's think about the question.  "What will become of this child?" is not unique to John.
It hangs over every life here.  As our children grow we find ourselves asking it about them.
What will they become?  Or the more accurate and important question: Who will they become?  As
they go through the teen years we can find ourselves asking it anxiously.  We can even find
ourselves asking it of our adult children.  Maybe you even ask it about yourself.  What will I
be?  Who will I become?  We address the question again in mid-life and it can be a scary time.
We revisit the question in our later years as we review our lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and gave a prophecy (which was God's answer to the
people's question) about his son that would come true after three decades: "And you, my little
son, will be called the prophet of the Most High, because you will prepare the way for the
Lord.  You will tell his people how to find salvation through forgiveness of their sins.
Because of God's tender mercy, the morning light from heaven is about to break upon us, to give
light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, and to guide us to the path of
peace."
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This question demands that we wait for God's grace.  The unfolding of a person's life is a long
process.  Sometimes we have to wait decades, two, three, sometimes four, five or six.  Waiting
for people to become who God has called them to be can be a long wait.  We are to be patient
and content and trusting at each stage is a gift.  I feel like I am a late bloomer myself.  We
trust God with moments and decades.
Finally let's look at the intertwining of Jesus' and John's lives.  This pattern reminds me of
the intertwining of Jesus' life and your lives.  Your life, your existence, your humanity is
intertwined with Jesus' life, your birth with his, your life with his, your death with his.
The Bible says that all of us live only in, through, by & for Jesus.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So intertwined are your existences that Paul the apostle wrote "we are convinced that one died
for all and therefore all died.  (Whatever happened to the one in whom we live, happened to
us.)  And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves, but for
him who died for them and was raised again." (2 Cor. 514) We are called to believe the truth
that our lives are united with his and to stop living as if we were separate from him because
he is the world's only Saviour.  Is that what you believe?  This is the gospel.  That is why
Jesus came and that is why we look forward to celebrating Christmas each year.  And we will
wait together one more week until the great day.  Peace to you as you wait.
