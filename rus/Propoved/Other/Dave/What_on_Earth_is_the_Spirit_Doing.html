In her book “girl meets God”, Lauren Winner, who came to Christ out of Orthodox Judaism, writes
“For a long time, the Holy Spirit stumped me.  I understood something of the Father—the Father
seemed basically to be the God of the Torah—and something of the Son.  But who was this third
person of the Trinity?  The Spirit seems the least easily defined person of God.”  You may be
able to identify with her.  For the next four Sundays we want to pay special attention to the
Holy Spirit who is with us and in us and is doing many things through us.  One of the best
places to start is to pay attention to how the Spirit was at work in Jesus as he shares his
life with us.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


The gospels tell of the Spirit coming upon Jesus in the form of a dove and immediately after
that, full of the Spirit, Jesus goes out into the wilderness for 40 days to be tempted by
Satan.  According to Luke Jesus, full of the Spirit’s power, then goes throughout Galilee
preaching in the synagogues.  During this time, he goes to his home town, Nazareth, and
explains to the people there what this baptism was for.  Luke presents Jesus’ giving his first
recorded public talk on what the Spirit was doing in his life.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong><em>Luke 4:16-21 -  When he came to the village of Nazareth, his boyhood home, he went
as usual to the synagogue on the Sabbath and stood up to read the Scriptures.  The scroll of
Isaiah the prophet was handed to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where this was
written:  “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he has anointed me to bring Good News to the
poor.  He has sent me to proclaim that captives will be released, that the blind will see, that
the oppressed will be set free, and that the time of the Lord’s favor has come.”  He rolled up
the scroll, handed it back to the attendant, and sat down. All eyes in the synagogue looked at
him intently.  Then he began to speak to them. “The Scripture you’ve just heard has been
fulfilled this very day!”   </em></strong>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We can feel the nostalgia in this story.  Here Jesus was in the building he had come to every
Sabbath since childhood.  The crowd full of familiar faces.  Most of his family is sitting near
the front.  One of his brothers is in the tech booth.  He’d only been gone a maybe a few
months, but people had heard of the teaching and the miracles he had done in other towns.  Now
he was back.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When a person stood up in the synagogue service it signaled that he wanted to read the
Scriptures.  The person reading the Scripture always read it standing up as a sign of
reverence.  Jesus stood up.  “Oh, good” everyone thought.  The scroll of Isaiah was handed to
him. The readings were ordered.  This Sabbath it was a particular passage from Isaiah.  Did
Jesus find the passage that was printed in the order of service?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  Maybe he
found the one that said what he wanted to say.  He read from the prophet Isaiah who was
speaking of when God would act to rescue Israel from exile in Babylon.  Jesus handed the scroll
back to the attendant and sat down to teach.  This was a way to say God’s word was supreme.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were glued on Jesus.   Jesus clears his throat and began
his message this way: <strong><em>“The Scripture you’ve just heard has been fulfilled this very
day!”</em></strong>  Just as God through the Spirit had sent Isaiah to preach God’s rescue of
his exiled people, so the Spirit has anointed and sent me as God’s ultimate word of
restoration, salvation and liberty.  The Spirit had chosen me and sent me to preach God’s
favour to the poor, the prisoners, the blind and the oppressed.  Right here.  Right now.  In
essence, Jesus had been chosen and sent by the Holy Spirit to be a talker.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Recently I heard someone say about a person, “She’s a real talker.”  That meant she would talk
on and on.  You may know people like that.  I know a fellow who has a hard time putting on the
verbal brakes.  To say that someone is a talker can also mean that that’s all they are – all
talk and no action. There are warnings in the Scripture for those who just talk a good talk.
Does this world really need more talkers?  Even if they are anointed and sent by God?  Even if
it is Jesus?  But Jesus was a talker who did things.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jesus had been anointed & sent by the Spirit to be a talker, but not just a talker, but to do
what his words said.  As some put it “He walked the talk.”  He didn’t just talk a good line
about liberation to a bunch of beat up people.  He liberated them.  He reached out and loved
the poor, the captives, those who were blind or oppressed, widows who were destitute, lepers
who were ignored & pushed into the corners of polite society (both widows & lepers came up in
an argument that broke out after Jesus’ sermon).  He lived out the spirit of 1 John 3:18 -
Let’s not merely say that we love; let us show the truth by our actions.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

That’s like us.  We have not been empowered to only say I love you, we have received the
Spiritual strength to love in action.  There is a saying that reflects the spirit of St.
Francis: <strong><em>"Preach the Gospel at all times. Use words if necessary."</em></strong>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wil Willimon tells the story about a young college student who was trying to talk the good
news.  He had been at a church gathering where a speaker had preached for an hour and got them
all worked up. At the end he said, “Okay, gang, are you ready to go out there and tell ‘em
about Jesus?’”  “Yeah!” they shouted back.   “Well get on the bus!”  As the bus moved along, it
was filled with singing, but as the bus drove deeper in the depths of the city, they gradually
stopped singing, and as they drove into one of the worst sections in the city all those college
kids were just staring out the windows. They were scared.  The bus stopped at a corner.
“Alright gang, get out there and tell ‘em about Jesus.  I’ll be back at five o’clock.”  And the
bus drove off.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This student went into a huge public housing project that had a terrible odor.  Windows were
out.  No lights in the hall.  He walked up a flight a stairs and heard a baby crying and
knocked on the door.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


“Who is it?” said a loud voice.  Then the door was cracked open & a woman, holding a naked
baby, peered out.  “What you want?” she asked in a hard, mean voice.  “I want to tell you about
Jesus,” he said.  With that, she swung the door open & began cursing him.  She cursed him all
the way down the hall, down the flight of steps & out to the sidewalk.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


He felt terrible.  A failure.  Some Christian I am.  How in the world could somebody like me
think that I could tell about Jesus?”  He sat on the curb and cried.  Then he looked up and
noticed a store on the corner, windows all boarded up, bars over the door.  He went into the
store, walked in and looked around.  Then he remembered.  The baby had no diapers.  The mother
was smoking.  He bought a box of disposable diapers & a pack of cigarettes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


He walked back to the tenement, said a prayer, went back to her door and knocked.
<strong><em>“Who is it?”</em></strong>  When she opened the door he slid the box of diapers &
the cigarettes in.  She looked at them, looked at him, and said, <strong><em>“Come
in.”</em></strong>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 “Sit down,” she commanded.  He sat down on the sofa, began to play with the baby.  He put a
diaper on the baby, even though he never did that before.  When the woman offered him a
cigarette, he took one - even though he didn’t smoke.  He stayed there all afternoon playing
with the baby and listening to the woman.  About four o’clock, the woman looked at him and
said, “Let me ask you something.  What’s a nice college boy like you doing in a place like
this?”  So he told her everything he knew about Jesus.  It took him about five minutes.  Then
she said, “Pray for me and my baby that we can make it out of here alive.”  And so before he
left, he prayed.  Sometimes “doing” the Scriptures looks a lot like buying diapers and
cigarettes.  We have been anointed and sent by the Spirit to talk to and to do the Scriptures.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When we talk to others, they may reject us, but, by the grace of God, they may listen.  We
should expect no greater success than Jesus.  The synagogue service in Nazareth ended badly,
and almost tragically, for Jesus.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jesus was a talker, but more than a talker.  And he was also a preacher.  That’s not always a
great thing to be called.  To say to someone “Don’t talk to me” can mean simply “I just want to
be left alone.  I don’t want to verbalize my thoughts and feelings right now.”  To say “Don’t
preach to me” has an edge to it.  It means “Don’t you dare tell me what to do.  Don’t decide
for me what is right or wrong.  Don’t give me your judgemental, moralizing lectures.”  People’s
minds do not always connect the word “preacher” to good things.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But Jesus was a preacher.  He had been anointed, chosen and sent by the Holy Spirit to preach.
But Jesus was more than a preacher.  He was a preacher who knew that he was to preach the word
of God and that reading  was part of preaching.  Jesus was also a reader.  He knew the
Scriptures and how to read them well.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That is something we can all do.  We have been anointed and sent by the Spirit to read the
Scriptures to others.  Like Jesus did.  There was a blind widow that I knew that liked to have
the Scriptures read to her.  Reading the Scriptures is a powerful thing to do.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tony Campolo tells the story about a preacher friend of his who had received a call from a
funeral director.  He was calling around to find someone to perform a funeral and nobody else
he had called wanted to do it because the man had died of AIDS.  He was a modern day leper.
The preacher told him he would take the funeral.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When he got to the funeral home, he found about 25-30 homosexual men waiting for him.  They
were in the room with the casket, sitting frozen in their chairs staring straight ahead.  It
was intimidating.  Some of them wore clothes that made who and what they were obvious.  He did
what he was supposed to do.  He read Scripture and prayed and made some remarks that preachers
do when they don’t know the dead person.   Then they all drove to the cemetery behind the
hearse.  They all got out of the cars and went over to the edge of the grave.  Not a word had
been spoken by any of the men from the beginning of the funeral, during the drive and through
the committal service at the grave.  They stood motionless.  He said the closing prayer and
turned to leave.  Then he realized that the men were not leaving.  So he went back and asked if
there was anything more he could do for them.  On of them finally spoke.  “Could you read the
23rd psalm?  When I got up this morning to come to this funeral, I was looking forward to
somebody reading the 23rd psalm to me.  I really like that psalm and I figured that they always
read the 23rd psalm.  So he read Psalm23 for the men.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When he finished, a second man spoke and asked him to read another passage of Scripture.  He
wanted to hear that part of the Bible where it says that there is nothing that can separate us
from the love of God .  So he read from the eighth chapter of Romans where Paul tells us that
neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor demons neither the present nor the future, nor any
powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate
us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.  As he read this the faces of the men
began to soften.  The one after the other, they made special request for me to read favourite
passages of Scripture.  He stood there for almost an hour reading Scripture to those homosexual
men before they went back to their cars and headed back.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What does this mean for us?  We are Jesus’ followers.  We are being drawn into his life.  We
are living out his life.  As Eugene Peterson wrote “We are not so much sent out by Jesus as
invited along.”  He is inviting us along in his mission as those who have also been anointed
and sent out by his Spirit to talk the Scriptures, to do the Scriptures, to preach the
Scriptures, to read the Scriptures.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Spirit has anointed us and sent us to the poor, the captives, the blind, the oppressed, the
widows and the lepers to talk and to do, to preach and to read.  This is what the Spirit is
doing.
