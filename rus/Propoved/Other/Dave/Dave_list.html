<td>
Однажды с деканом я собирал рекламные материалы, чтобы оставить их в церкви, куда мы
отправлялись в выходные, и он, видя,  что я взял целую груду брошюр, сказал "Ты можешь положить
часть назад. Мы не хотим быть расточительными".

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Расточительными?
<br>Единственное место, в котором я встречал это слово, было в рассказанной Иисусом притче,
которая стала известна как притча o расточительном сыне. Сын взял свою долю отцовского
состояния и потратил его в разгульной жизни, а затем приполз назад к отцу, когда разорился.

In our minds God is old.  Beyond old, he is ancient.  While we may mentally affirm that God
exists beyond time, we still link him with well…being old.  Michelangelo’s masterpiece “The
Creation of Adam” in the Cistene Chapel doesn’t help as he painted God with flowing white hair
and beard.

In a few days cries of "Happy Holidays" will fill the air.  For those who want to be more
pointed and I am among them, we will say "Merry Christmas."  But if we want to go further in
the spirit of the actual nativity story as it is written in the Bible, I am suggesting that we
adopt a new greeting this year.  Let's wish each other "A Very Inconvenient Christmas and a
Truly Interrupted New Year!"  After all, that's how it all began.  We love convenience and we
don't like interruptions but this is precisely how Jesus, the Son of God, came to earth, with
great inconvenience and as a huge interruption.

What was last Thursday?  Ascension!  What's next Sunday?  Pentecost!  We're living between
Ascension on the one hand (departure of Jesus to heaven) & Pentecost on the other (the coming
of the promised Spirit).  In the Bible, there is a 10 day gap between the promise of the Spirit
by Jesus just before he ascended, and the Spirit's arrival.  Why the delay?  Why not a seamless
transition?  What is supposed to be happening?  What did God want to do among these people who
had been through so much trauma in the last few weeks?  These questions can be ours too during
these days of ours.  What does God want to do among us who have been through so much in the
last few weeks?  There is only one recorded thing that happened during those 10 days and it is
a story that has been given to us today.  We are told all about it in Acts 1:12- 26.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"What are you doing?!"</em>  This is the question that
parents call out when their children in the next room are unusually quiet.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<em>"What do you do?"</em>  This is the question that comes up in conversation among adults.
It wants to find out what is important to us: what people do.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<em>"Are you doing what you're supposed to be doing?"</em>  This is the question that gets to
the heart of your life.

How many here ever had a lemonade stand?  You know, when you wait for a warm summer day and
make some lemonade and set up a table next to the road or sidewalk in front of your home and
past a sign “Lemonade 5 cents a glass” or whatever you thought the market would bear.  I did
once I believe.  Sunkist, the company who market oranges, is helping children “take a stand.”
Sunkist is calling all kids, 7 to 12 years of age, across the US and Canada to "Take a Stand"
for their favourite charity.  All the money that they make they give to the charity of their
choice.

Last Sunday night as I was turning over in my mind what I had planned to say this morning, I
sensed that it had become flat, with no sense of inner life and urgency.  I sensed I was being
drawn by God to speak on the Spirit and how to respond to his presence among us.  This did not
surprise me as some questions had been raised during the Father's Heart Conference last weekend
about a few things that were witnessed.  Keeping in step with the Spirit is also a theme in the
spiritual formation of a congregation and so it also fits our present series <strong><em>How
God grows People</em></strong>.  I will look to the apostle Paul for my guidance.

This notice was posted on the web Mar 23, 2007: Looking for Birth Mother.  My name at birth was
Stanley Valmore Hiscock.  I was born at Wellesley Hospital in Toronto, on July 14,16? 1966.  On
Aug 3, 1966 I was admitted to the care of the Children's Aid Society in Scarborough Ontario.  I
was placed in my adoptive parents’ home Dec 13, 1966.  My birth mother was born & raised in
Newfoundland; she was the child of a single mother, & had no info on her birth father.  My
mother lived with her grandmother until the age of 12.  When my B-grandmother married, my
mother tried to live with the newly married couple. She found it difficult adjusting to a
stepfather and her half-siblings, two boys and a girl.  At that point in my mother’s life she
moved in with an aunt and uncle.  My mother left school at age 16 to join the work force, my
mother and a girl friend decided to leave Newfoundland and moved to Toronto to find work.  My
mother met my father in a boarding house in Toronto, he was 27 at my birth, he was born in
Greece, he worked as a waiter and a bartender.  My mother was 21 at my birth, she did not tell
my father or her family about my birth.  Please contact Robert.

<td>
When I was in Bible College in the 70's, I was part of a male quartet that traveled to churches
representing the school.  One day I was with the dean getting some promotional material
together to leave at the church we were going to that weekend and he saw me take a whole pile
of pamphlets and said <strong>"You can put some back.  We don't want to be prodigal with
them."</strong>  Prodigal?  The only place I knew that word from was from one of the parables
that Jesus told that had come to be known as the Parable of the Prodigal Son.  A son took his
cut of his father's estate and spent it in wild living and then came crawling back to daddy
when he was broke.  Did the dean think that I would run off with these pamphlets and wildly
litter the streets with them?  I asked him what prodigal meant?  <strong>"Wasteful."</strong>
Ah, too many pamphlets means many would be wasted.  The young man wasted his share of his
father's estate.  So we could call Jesus' story The Parable of the Wasteful Son.

I'm not what you would call a daredevil.  I don't bungee jump or sky-dive.  I like to do new
things and I don't mind doing some things that have an element of risk to them but I don't tend
to push the limits too hard.  There are some people who love to do that.  They are up for
anything intensely physical, anything extreme or even dangerous.  But not me.

Today we are going to eject two troublemakers out of Northview Community Church.  I don't know
if you are all aware of what these two rascals have been trying to do, but I want all of us to
agree to kick them out today because they are up to no good.  They will not leave on their own.
 They are too stubborn to do that.  They will need to be removed, perhaps forcibly, and today
is the day.  Some of you may know their identities, others may not.  I am going to out them.
Their names are <strong>Us and Them</strong>.  Together, over the course of time, they have
begun wars, divided countries, changed neighbours into combatants, complicated workplaces and
split churches.  They are constantly in the news.  And they are often in the pews.  And today
we will show them the door.

Christmas is a time when we celebrate a joyful story of a great birth, but it is also a time
when you hear sad stories that seem all the sadder because they happen near Christmas.
<br>Many of them involve children.  This is one of them.  Johnny was born to parents who never
seemed to have the kind of relationship with their son that many other people manage to enjoy.
<br>They were very religious people, and quite strict.  I don't know a lot about his
relationship with his parents, but I think they were out of his life when he was just a very
young man.

In her book “girl meets God”, Lauren Winner, who came to Christ out of Orthodox Judaism, writes
“For a long time, the Holy Spirit stumped me.  I understood something of the Father—the Father
seemed basically to be the God of the Torah—and something of the Son.  But who was this third
person of the Trinity?  The Spirit seems the least easily defined person of God.”  You may be
able to identify with her.  For the next four Sundays we want to pay special attention to the
Holy Spirit who is with us and in us and is doing many things through us.  One of the best
places to start is to pay attention to how the Spirit was at work in Jesus as he shares his
life with us.
