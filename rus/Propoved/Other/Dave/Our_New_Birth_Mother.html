This notice was posted on the web Mar 23, 2007: Looking for Birth Mother.  My name at birth was
Stanley Valmore Hiscock.  I was born at Wellesley Hospital in Toronto, on July 14,16? 1966.  On
Aug 3, 1966 I was admitted to the care of the Children's Aid Society in Scarborough Ontario.  I
was placed in my adoptive parents’ home Dec 13, 1966.  My birth mother was born & raised in
Newfoundland; she was the child of a single mother, & had no info on her birth father.  My
mother lived with her grandmother until the age of 12.  When my B-grandmother married, my
mother tried to live with the newly married couple. She found it difficult adjusting to a
stepfather and her half-siblings, two boys and a girl.  At that point in my mother’s life she
moved in with an aunt and uncle.  My mother left school at age 16 to join the work force, my
mother and a girl friend decided to leave Newfoundland and moved to Toronto to find work.  My
mother met my father in a boarding house in Toronto, he was 27 at my birth, he was born in
Greece, he worked as a waiter and a bartender.  My mother was 21 at my birth, she did not tell
my father or her family about my birth.  Please contact Robert.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The one thing that ties the life of this man to this woman is the event of childbirth that was
the culmination of nine months of indwelling.  I sometimes envy Margie.  She got to carry our
children for nine months and give birth to them.  While our children were all Caesarian births,
she as their mother gave birth to them.  I did not.  I participated in their conception and am
bound to them through that, but carrying them and giving birth to them was all Margie.  Now I
observed the births.  I could describe them.  On a certain level I could understand what was
going on, but those births took me beyond what is common, normal, everyday, familiar, easy to
comprehend.  It seems that births do that.  Two men were once talking about this very thing.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong><em>John 3:1-12 - There was a man named Nicodemus, a Jewish religious leader who was a
Pharisee.  After dark one evening, he came to speak with Jesus. “Rabbi,” he said, “we all know
that God has sent you to teach us. Your miraculous signs are evidence that God is with you.”
</em></strong>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jesus replied, <strong><em>“I tell you the truth, unless you are born again, you cannot see the
Kingdom of God.” </em></strong> <strong><em>“What do you mean?” </em></strong>exclaimed
Nicodemus. <strong><em>“How can an old man go back into his mother’s womb and be born again?”
</em></strong>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jesus replied,<strong><em> “I assure you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God without being
born of water and the Spirit.  Humans can reproduce only human life, but the Holy Spirit gives
birth to spiritual life. </em></strong>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong><em>So don’t be surprised when I say, ‘You must be born again.’  The wind blows
wherever it wants. Just as you can hear the wind but can’t tell where it comes from or where it
is going, so you can’t explain how people are born of the Spirit.” </em></strong>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<strong><em>“How are these things possible?” Nicodemus asked.  Jesus replied, “You are a
respected Jewish teacher & yet you don’t understand these things?  I assure you, we tell you
what we know and have seen, and yet you won’t believe our testimony.  But if you don’t believe
me when I tell you about earthly things, how can you possibly believe if I tell you about
heavenly things?</em></strong>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you are anything like Nicodemus you might be as confused as he is.  How can we blame him?
He makes a simple comment to Jesus that is complimentary as well and Jesus answers him with a
baffling jumble of words about birth and wind and water and flesh and God and life and
meteorological ignorance and how come you can’t keep up with me Nicodemus?  It’s hard to keep
it all straight.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now Nicodemus was no dummy.  He belonged to the influential religious group called the
Pharisees who were zealous followers of the Jewish Law & he was also a member of the highest
Jewish court that existed at that time, the Sanhedrin.  This meant he was an educated religious
scholar, someone who was deeply motivated, even driven to understand & explain things.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


Now perhaps he came to Jesus after dark because he was afraid of ruining his reputation.  His
colleagues would look down on him for having a private interview with Jesus.  Jesus was to them
an undisciplined and dangerous teacher.  But instead of avoiding Jesus altogether Nicodemus
comes at night.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


The conversation starts out well enough.  “Rabbi,” (which many of his associates would have
deemed a careless use of the word, to call Jesus a rabbi) “we know that God has sent you to
teach.  (Possibly only a small minority of his colleagues had concluded this.)  You couldn’t do
the miraculous signs you do if God wasn’t with you.”
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



So Jesus starts teaching: “The truth Nicodemus: People cannot participate in the kingdom of
God, the life of God, unless they have been born in a new way.”  Does Jesus mean “born from
above”?  Or does he mean “born again”?  The word Jesus uses could be taken either way, but John
seems to favour “from above” when he uses this word in other places    Jesus often confuses
people he talks to and when he speaks they misunderstand him.  Nicodemus opts for “born again”
and so has an immediate problem.  “How can an old man, let alone anyone, go back into his
mother’s womb and be born again?”
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jesus doesn’t skip a beat and continues: “The truth, Nicodemus:  no one can enter the Kingdom
of God without being born in a new way, born of water and wind.”  Maybe that’s how Nicodemus
heard it.  We are used to reading water and Spirit, but the word for Spirit is the same word
for wind and the same word for breath.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Maybe Nicodemus heard “born of water and wind” and thought “What?”  I believe Jesus is talking
about being born by water through John’s baptism for he was sent to baptize with water and
being born by the Spirit through Jesus who was sent to baptize with the Spirit.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jesus continues:  Flesh gives birth to flesh, but Spirit gives birth to spirit.  And maybe that
is how Nicodemus understood the triple-meaning word this time, not as wind but as Spirit.
Jesus is contrasting human and divine life so flesh and Spirit makes sense.  This Nicodemus
could grasp!  “Humans can only give birth to human life, but the Spirit gives birth to
spiritual life.  So don’t be surprised when I say “You must be born from above” or born again,
to use Nicodemus’ words.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Just when Nicodemus understands that Jesus is talking about the Spirit, not about the wind,
Jesus goes back to wind.  The wind blows wherever it wants.  You can hear the wind but can’t
tell where it comes from or where it is going, (the ways of the wind are beyond us, even with
modern technology we are at its mercy).  And maybe Nicodemus hears Jesus’ last sentence like
this: “So too you can’t explain how people are born of the wind.”  We jump in with “No
Nicodemus, Jesus means born of the Spirit now, not wind.”
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nicodemus is so confused now.  “How does this kind of thing happen?”
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Nicodemus, you are a top scholar, a highly respected teacher in Israel, but you have no idea
do you?  You don’t even believe let alone understand these simple things.  Imagine what a
problem you would have if I tried to teach you the graduate level material.  Nicodemus hadn’t
grasped what Jesus was saying.  He had no understanding of this new birth that Jesus was
speaking about.  And he fades away and drops out of the conversation still in ignorance.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We shake our heads Silly Nicodemus! He doesn’t understand.  So much for the value of
theological education!  He doesn’t get it, but we do!  We’re born again Christians!  This is
our chapter in the Bible!  The “born again” chapter!  It’s crystal clear to us!  This is
religious kindergarten.  A, B, C!
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I remember preparing a Bible study on this conversation for a group of young people a number of
years ago.  My challenge was to get them to understand this conversation, remove all the
haziness, all the double speak, all the mystery.  I brought my commentaries for them to do some
of the research.  Okay group we’re going to nail this passage down so we understand it!  I
spoke with great confidence.  At the end of our study, we’ll be able to say “This is what it
means.”  We will sweep any ignorance away.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I hope they have forgotten that night.  To approach this passage and treat it like child’s play
is to come to it incorrectly.  The point of studying this passage is not to remove the mystery,
but to believe in the mystery of the new birth, to come to realize our need for this new birth
and to seek it from the one who gives it, the Holy Spirit.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jesus provides no chart, no steps to how to get yourself born by the Spirit.  It is a mystery
of grace.  How did you get yourself born into this world?  You received it as a gift from God.
You did not know what was happening.  You were not in control of it.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sometimes people speak of the baby as understanding what is going on and being in control of
its own birth!  “You’re overdue?  Don’t worry.  The baby will know when to come.”  It is rather
that the baby is resting comfortably until a contraction hits and “Uh-oh!”  We are clueless in
our own births.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We can approach the new birth in the same terms.  You do this, then God does this and presto,
chango, you’re born again!  No mystery!
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But ignorance is part of the new birth.  It is by faith after all.  Dan Whittle wrote a hymn
that expresses the grace of healthy ignorance: “I don’t know how faith works, I don’t know how
the Spirit moves in me.  But I know the person I believe in.”  Ignorance is good when it leads
us to the one who is our teacher.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I’m like Nicodemus.  I love to understand things and be able to explain them.  To have you come
to me after the service and say “Now I understand that passage.  You made it so clear.  All my
questions have been answered!” would be music to my ears, but this passage is given not to make
everything crystal clear, but to lead us to tremble and be weak-kneed in the presence of God
who can do such a thing.  For all those fathers who have ever fainted when their wives were
giving birth to their children, I think you got it right.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When we come to this talk between Jesus and Nicodemus from a position of knowledge, we might
say “Well, I’m past needing to be born again.  I’m born again already.  So the only thing left
for me to know from this passage is how to talk to others about their need to be born again.
And we miss out on the mystery of what has and is going on in our lives and what has yet to go
on as the Spirit continues to ground us in the reality of that birth.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Having been born by the Spirit may mean many more births for us.  Just as many small deaths
occur on our lives through sickness and loss before our physical death, many smaller births
occur after the initial spiritual one.  There are still some areas of our lives that need to be
born from above, born again.  We are still living in the old ways.  We have become old and
shaky in our faith and our love.  Maybe Nicodemus speaks better than he knows when he questions
whether an old person can be born again.  That is my hope.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Birth is all about grace, wonder, miracle, mystery and glory.  Jesus doesn’t explain the new
birth, laying it all out for poor Nicodemus.  He left as confused as when he came if not more.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But the Spirit did not forget about him.  Nicodemus comes into view again after some of his
brother Pharisees had sent guards to arrest Jesus but they had been so overcome with his
teaching (about what else but “water” and “Spirit”!) that they couldn’t arrest him.   Nicodemus
protests their action.  “Does our law condemn a man before hearing him?”  And later when Jesus
was dead, Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus came and took the body down from the cross and they
both wrapped it, with the 75 pounds of spices that Nicodemus brought spices, in strips of linen
and laid it in the tomb.  And a few days after that I think in faith, he experienced the
mystery of the new birth for himself.
