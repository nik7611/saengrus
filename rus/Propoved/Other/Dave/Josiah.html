<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many here ever had a lemonade stand?  You know,
when you wait for a warm summer day and make some lemonade and set up a table next to the road
or sidewalk in front of your home and past a sign “Lemonade 5 cents a glass” or whatever you
thought the market would bear.  I did once I believe.  Sunkist, the company who market oranges,
is helping children “take a stand.”   Sunkist is calling all kids, 7 to 12 years of age, across
the US and Canada to "Take a Stand" for their favourite charity.  All the money that they make
they give to the charity of their choice.  In 2005, kids applied for free "Take a Stand"
lemonade stands and Sunkist’s supply of 2,000 stands quickly disappeared.  In 2006, Sunkist
gave away 10,000 “Take a Stand” lemonade stands to kids who wanted to help change their
communities.  Sunkist will send out even more lemonade stands this year.  You have to hand it
to these children.  They are trying to change their world by “taking a stand.”  And no stand is
too small.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Taking a stand to help change the world demands something from our souls.  And so we turn our
attention to a person in the Sunkist “Take a Stand” age range of 7 to 12 years old.   Josiah.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Josiah didn’t have a great spiritual heritage.  He came from a family of rampant idolaters.
Josiah’s grandfather Mannaseh was the worst king that the kingdom of Judah ever had.  He
reigned as king for 55 years.  He immersed himself into the occult and sacrificed his sons.  He
imported sexualized religion into the temple, a mixture of distorted worship and prostitution
from Assyria and the whole kingdom followed him into this moral and political mess.  Obscene
idols and altars to lewd gods were everywhere.  The temple had become a red light district.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Late in life Mannaseh finally realized his foolishness and turned to God and tried to undo all
the damage that he had done.  He was partially successful.  His son, Amon, who reigned after
his death, reinstituted the foolishness of his father, but was assassinated after 2 years and
his son Josiah ended up on the throne at the tender age of eight, far too young to be a king it
seems to us.  Talk about being robbed of your childhood.  At the age when some children are
making lemonade stands, he is creating and enforcing national policy.  It’s a little tough to
identity with him.  Unless we realize that he was called to live out his faith in public view
which is where we are called to live ours out as well.  Leaders can cave in to their family
history, to the prevailing culture, to the voices of the people, the desire to be liked, just
like we can.

<td>2 Chronicles 34: (Josiah's Reforms)<br>
 1 Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one
years. <br>2 He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD and walked in the ways of his father
David, not turning aside to the right or to the left.
<br>
 3 In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, he began to seek the God of his
father David. In his twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of high places, Asherah
poles, carved idols and cast images. <br>4 Under his direction the altars of the Baals were
torn down; he cut to pieces the incense altars that were above them, and smashed the Asherah
poles, the idols and the images. These he broke to pieces and scattered over the graves of
those who had sacrificed to them. <br>5 He burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and
so he purged Judah and Jerusalem. <br>6 In the towns of Manasseh, Ephraim and Simeon, as far as
Naphtali, and in the ruins around them, <br>7 he tore down the altars and the Asherah poles and
crushed the idols to powder and cut to pieces all the incense altars throughout Israel. Then he
went back to Jerusalem.

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We read that in the eighth year of his reign, which
would make him 16, something happened.  Maybe a number of things happened.  He discovered
girls?  He started to nifty little chin beard?  He loved to drive the royal chariot a little
faster than he should?  But what also happened in Josiah was that he began to seek God.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Maybe he looked back over his nation’s past and saw the handprints of God all over it.  Or
maybe he saw the corruption all around him and the price people were paying and thought
<em>“There’s got to be something more than this.”</em>  Or maybe he thought about old Grampa
Mannaseh who had changed his ways late in life.  Or maybe he was asking some of the first order
questions of life - <em>“Who am I and why am I here?  What am I supposed to be doing as
king?”</em>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
During the next 4 years, Josiah thought of how things could be in Judah.  A nation devoted to
God.  And at the ripe old age of 20, in his twelfth year as king, he said <em>“No More.”</em>
He carted out all the altars and images of gods from the temple and burned them, ground them up
and scattered the dust over the graves of their worshippers.  <em>“No More.”</em>  He tore down
the rooms used by male shrine prostitutes and the places where idol decorations were made.
<em>“No More.”</em>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

When he finished in the temple, there was the whole city of Jerusalem, filled to the brim with
idols.  <em>“No More.”</em>  He sees these idols for what they are, signs of the enemy of his
people & his own soul.  <em>“No More.”</em>  He destroyed shrine after shrine after shrine &
smashed countless altars & Asherah poles and defiled the altars by burning human bones on them
and slaughtered the priests on their own altars.  <em>“No More.”</em>  Then he went home.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Gory, bloody, R rated for violence.  We are shocked at the force, the brutality & intolerance.
We want Josiah to be 8 years old again, playing kickball in his palace, setting up a lemonade
stand in his throne room & ordering attendants to buy.  If someone claiming to be a Christian
did these things today we would call such a person evil & distance ourselves from him.  We read
of terrible atrocities being committed against people in other parts of the world in the name
of religion & we pray that God would stop it.  How can these be the actions of a righteous
person?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Josiah’s ancient ideas of righteous behaviour are different than ours.  Righteousness looks
different in different ages and cultures.   God has worked within human societies and many have
dropped their assumptions that such violence is normal and acceptable.  He has brought us as
his church to the place where we have serious gospel questions about the violence that we see
carried out in the name of religion.  We need to be very careful when we take a stand.  We need
to be discerning & responsive to God.
We can end up listening to our own zeal and not God.  Our <em>“No More”</em> can become so loud
that we can no longer hear God’s voice.  Later in Josiah’s life it seemed like he couldn’t
discern the words of God when they came to him.

<td>2 Chronicles 35:<br>
20 After all this, when Josiah had set the temple in order, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight
at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah marched out to meet him in battle. <br>21 But Neco
sent messengers to him, saying, "What quarrel is there between you and me, O king of Judah? It
is not you I am attacking at this time, but the house with which I am at war. God has told me
to hurry; so stop opposing God, who is with me, or he will destroy you."<br>

22 Josiah, however, would not turn away from him, but disguised himself to engage him in
battle. He would not listen to what Neco had said at God's command but went to fight him on the
plain of Megiddo.
<br>
 23 Archers shot King Josiah, and he told his officers, "Take me away; I am badly wounded."
<br>24 So they took him out of his chariot, put him in the other chariot he had and brought him
to Jerusalem, where he died. He was buried in the tombs of his fathers, and all Judah and
Jerusalem mourned for him.

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Josiah’s world is very different to ours.  The
religious pluralism that we accept as normal (though perhaps irritating?) was positively
repulsive to Josiah.  Would we want a ruler who served God like this?  That’s why people are
nervous when evangelical Christians who hold to the Bible get into politics.  This is the kind
of thing they are afraid of.  Josiah for Prime Minister?  His ideas of faithfulness to God are
different from ours; his ideas of taking a stand are different.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But we must pay attention to one thing deep in Josiah’s heart: take a stand  against idolatry.
The human heart has the distressing capacity to idolize anything.   Even centuries later the
New Testament writers 1 Corinthians 10:14 - <strong><em>My dear friends, flee from
idolatry.</em></strong>  1 John 5:21 <strong><em>Dear children, keep yourselves from
idols.</em></strong>
   <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How is Northview in this regard?  Let’s congratulate ourselves.  No idols here!  Check out the
whole church.  Eli and Lina, run across any idols as you clean the church?  No, we only worship
God here.  Zero tolerance.  <em>“No More.”</em> We are an idol-free zone.  We have one of those
green signs on our front door telling people it’s safe to worship here.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Check out our homes.  When you are over someone’s home next, check them out.  Is that an idol?
No Royal Doulton.  What about that?  Precious Moments figurine.  What’s that in your garden?  A
statue of St. Francis of Assissi.  What about those seeds on that platter in front of St.
Francis?  Is that an offering.  It’s for birds!  OK.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But what about our hearts?  There is something about the human heart - it cannot not worship.
It will worship something.  It is not like we can pull back from God and have a god-free life.
Something will be our god.  We create idols.  We will worship something.  We will put our lives
at the service of some power.  We will lay our live on some altar.  Knowledge can be our god.
Goddess of getting ahead.  Deity of drink and drug.  Celebrity cults.  Paul writes about some
people in Phil 3 whose god is their stomach.  They worshipped and served their bodily
appetites.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Josiah’s age was a sensuous one, a sexualized age so much like our own.  In Josiah’s kingdom,
corrupted sex and idolatry were intertwined.  They always are.  God addresses idolatry within
the church in Ephesians 5: Among you there should be no immorality, impurity or covetousness,
greed (here it would mean body-greed, desire to possess and exploit someone’s body).  Nor
should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking about sex, but rather a heart of
thanksgiving for such a gift!
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Colossians 3 - Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual
immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed (body greed), which is idolatry.  There’s a
big reason for body greed to be connected with idolatry.   Body greed makes an idol of another
person’s body.  It is not made of wood or stone or metal, but flesh and blood.  They worship
the image.  Their calls to worship are seen on billboards and posters.  Their prophets, priests
and evangelists are persuasive.  They coax us to be baptized into this way of life.  But we are
given the strength by God to take a stand as Josiah did, against all pretender gods.   <em>“No
More.”</em>  We are those who have turned from idols to serve the living and true God.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We are grateful that Jesus does not deal with this idolatry that so many struggle with as
Josiah did by sacrificing us on an altar of our own making, but rather he sacrificed himself to
free us from sin.  On the cross, he took a stand.  When he rose form the dead he said <em>“No
more.”</em>  And by faith we participate in his stand and speak out his <em>“No More”</em> in
our own lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I leave you with these words from 2 Cor:  <strong><em>“So leave the corruption and compromise;
leave it for good,”</em></strong> says God.  <strong><em>“Don't link up with those who will
pollute you.  I want you all for myself.  I’ll be a Father to you; you’ll be sons and daughters
to me.”</em></strong>  With promises like this to pull us on, dear friends, let's make a clean
break with everything that defiles or distracts us, both within and without. Let's make our
entire lives fit and holy temples for the worship of God. <br> Amen.
