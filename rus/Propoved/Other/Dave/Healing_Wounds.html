<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was last Thursday?  Ascension!  What's next
Sunday?  Pentecost!  We're living between Ascension on the one hand (departure of Jesus to
heaven) & Pentecost on the other (the coming of the promised Spirit).  In the Bible, there is a
10 day gap between the promise of the Spirit by Jesus just before he ascended, and the Spirit's
arrival.  Why the delay?  Why not a seamless transition?  What is supposed to be happening?
What did God want to do among these people who had been through so much trauma in the last few
weeks?  These questions can be ours too during these days of ours.  What does God want to do
among us who have been through so much in the last few weeks?  There is only one recorded thing
that happened during those 10 days and it is a story that has been given to us today.  We are
told all about it in Acts 1:12- 26.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong><em>Then the apostle returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, a distance of half
a mile.  When they arrived, they went to the upstairs room of the house where they were
staying. Here are the names of those who were present: Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip,
Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James (son of Alphaeus), Simon (the Zealot), & Judas (son of
James).  They all met together and were constantly united in prayer, along with Mary the mother
of Jesus, several other women, and the brothers of Jesus.</em></strong>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong><em>During this time, when about 120 believers were together in one place, Peter stood
up and addressed them.  "Brothers and sisters," he said, "the Scriptures had to be fulfilled
concerning Judas, who guided those who arrested Jesus. This was predicted long ago by the Holy
Spirit, speaking through King David.  Judas was one of us and shared in the ministry with us."
</em></strong>           (Judas had bought a field with the money he received for his
treachery. Falling headfirst there, his body split open, spilling out all his intestines.  The
news of his death spread to all the people of Jerusalem, and they gave the place the Aramaic
name Akeldama, which means "Field of Blood.")

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong><em>Peter continued, "This was written in the book of Psalms, where it says, 'Let his
home become desolate, with no one living in it.' It also says, 'Let someone else take his
position.'  So now we must choose a replacement for Judas from among the men who were with us
the entire time we were traveling with the Lord Jesus-from the time he was baptized by John
until the day he was taken from us.  Whoever is chosen will join us as a witness of Jesus'
resurrection."</em></strong> <br>
So they nominated two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias.  Then
they all prayed, "O Lord, you know every heart. <br>
Show us which of these men you have chosen as an apostle to replace Judas in this ministry, for
he has deserted us & gone where he belongs."  Then they cast lots, and Matthias was selected to
become an apostle with the other 11.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Soon summer camps will be in full swing.  Camp Wanakita is a YMCA camp on Koshlong Lake in the
Haliburton Highlands where kids enjoy all the usual camp things.  But Camp Wanakita is a
special camp.  It has programs for children with hemophilia.  Hemophilia is a blood disorder
that affects the ability of blood to clot.   When severely wounded, people with hemophilia can
bleed for a long time before the blood clots and a scab forms and healing takes hold.  We all
suffer to some degree from spiritual hemophilia.  When we are wounded we bleed.  We are wounded
now.  What will bring healing?
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 11disciples were bleeding.  The 11-it sounds strange like an unfinished scale played on the
piano.  Jesus had just ascended into heaven after being with them on the Mount of Olives.  He
had told them to go to Jerusalem to wait for the gift of the Holy Spirit & so they began their
walk to the city.  Luke tells us that the garden of Gethsemane was on the Mount of Olives.
They hadn't been here since the night Jesus was arrested & even though Jesus had triumphed,
they couldn't pretend the betrayal hadn't happened.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Imagine their walk.  James taps John on the shoulder and points toward the grove where Jesus
had been arrested.  John just shakes his head.  Thomas spies a torch beside the road that
someone in the arresting party had dropped when it flickered and died.  He helps it into the
ditch with a kick.  Simon the Zealot chuckles as he recalls Jesus healing the ear of the high
priest's servant after Peter had just cut if off.  "You owe your symmetry to the Lord Jesus
fellah."  Then his face clouds as he recalls the betrayal that started it all.  Bartholomew
stops to look back at the clouds into which Jesus had just ascended.  Then he remembers how
Judas Iscariot always used to dilly dally at the back of the group fumbling with the purse that
carried the group's spending money, (Crook!) so he picks up his pace as they near the city.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


Maybe Andrew looked south in the direction of the field where Judas had been found face down
with his intestines spilled out, grisly scene.  Everyone in Jerusalem began calling it Field of
Blood.  Their wound was public knowledge.  Because of his background in finances, maybe Matthew
was feeling pressure to become the next treasurer, the job that Judas had held, but the task
held no appeal for him.  They entered Jerusalem and went right to the room where they were
staying.  It was a large upper room, one that held vivid Passover memories.  Imagine Philip &
James the son of Alphaeus looking around.  They recall the Passover meal, the words & actions
of Jesus, how Jesus washed all the disciples' feet, even the feet of Judas!  His feet were
clean when he left to meet with the religious leaders to plan the betrayal.  Maybe the other
disciple named Judas was feeling his good name had been trashed and was now asking people to
call him by his other name, Thaddeus!
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Soon, some women came, then Mary, Jesus' mother.  We can imagine Mary, gentle soul, thinking of
Simon Iscariot, Judas' father.  Family members feel unique pain.  Jesus' brothers, recent
believers come.  Soon about 120.  God had given them these 10 days to prayerfully wait
together.  As Peter was praying with the others, he was bothered.  While the joy of
resurrection and ascension filled him, he was still trying to come to grips with the fact that
one of Jesus' own had betrayed him. Jesus had told them that the betrayal was a fulfillment of
prophecy, but that seemed to bring little relief.   How could something so dark have been so
close?!  Peter opened his mouth to speak.  What he said came out of his prayerful waiting with
the others.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Brothers & sisters, the Scripture that the Spirit spoke through David concerning Judas had to
be fulfilled" ( "Judas served as guide for those who arrested Jesus (pause) "he was one of our
number & shared in this ministry." There!  He had said it, Judas was "one of us."
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It's the same today.  Occasionally someone outside the church may wound us, but many times,
maybe most, it is one of us, a Christian brother or sister, a trusted colleague, a loved
co-worker, a long-time core member, a friend.  Because it is one of us, it can hurt more.  If
the imagery of the one body of Christ means anything, it means that there is no us & them.  It
is always one of us.  There is a sense in which one Christian can wound another, but the fact
that the church is the body of Christ means the wounds are always self-inflicted.  We wound
ourselves.
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Some wounds are national/global. The church's failings in Ireland & Rwanda have touched us
because we are the church.  The church has been wounded by her ministers & priests guilty of
sexual abuse charges.
Careless words & actions of some of our more public brothers & sisters hurt us. Some wounds are
congregational.  We can feel betrayed by one of our own.  Wounds can come from families,
Christian parent, child or spouse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To rewrite my history in the church in terms of one of us does not allow me the freedom to
dissect the church into us and them.  As I reflect on my experience, it was not a stranger who
wounded the church through indiscretion, it was one of us.  It was not those previous two
pastors that caused the church grief, it was two of us.  It was not that deceitful treasurer
who stole funds and destroyed trust and friendship and threw a church into dazed confusion, it
was one of us.  It was not that sexual predator who brought tears, struggle, anger & pain, it
was one of us.  It was not an enemy who crushed me.  It was one of us.  Each church has a
history of wounds.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How will the disciples be healed?  This is Peter's question and he wants healing. And he is led
to the Psalms.  Peter tells the group about King David's enemies.  It says in the Psalms "May
his place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in it."  But it also says "May another take
his place of leadership."  David has his enemies and Jesus, the son of David, had his and their
fortunes are linked together.  We must find someone to replace Judas.  <br>
What would the requirements be?  Peter had been prepared by God as he prayed. He should use
requirements that reflected the experience of the 11.  They had been with Jesus from the early
days when John was baptizing people right up to the ascension of Jesus.  These would be the
requirements of the new person who must become a witness of Jesus' resurrection.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
They came up with a short list of two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and
Matthias.  Which one?  They turned to the Lord who knew both of these men well as they had
travelled with him.  He had chosen the first 12 - he would choose this one.  They resumed the
rhythm of the past few days and once again the entire group prayed "Lord, 'Heart-knower of
all.'  We don't know who it should be.  Show us now which of these two men you have chosen to
take over this apostolic ministry, and then, with some restraint, they add "which Judas left to
go where he belongs."  <br>
Question. Could they trust Jesus now to provide someone else?  He had chosen Judas!  When you
are love incarnate, you embrace and include even those people who will hurt you.  It is not
mistake to do so.  It is the life and love of God in action.  Jesus always chooses well.
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

After committing the choice to Jesus, they casts lots, throwing down various kinds of marked
objects in order to determine God's will.  The practice was quite common among God's people and
was supported in Proverbs 16:33 <strong><em>"The lot is cast into the lap, but its every
decision is from the Lord."</em></strong>   Their deep trust in Jesus to choose a replacement
is the significant truth here, not the use of a cultural means of expressing that trust.  As
the lots scattered on the floor, the last piece teetered on its edge and then fell on its side.
 Matthias!  Joseph Barsabbas calls out "How about the best out of three!  Just kidding.  Jesus
has chosen!  So Matthias was added to the eleven disciples."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
God led these people through the pain of betrayal & chose a person to bring his  healing:
Matthias.  Who is he?  The Anglican church down the street from my previous church is named
after him.  Tradition says he was one of the 70 who worked with Jesus and that later he worked
among the Ethiopians and perhaps was martyred in Judea.  He's unknown to us but he was a gift
to the 11.  He was given by Jesus in place of Judas.  Christ takes Matthias and places his life
like a ointment into the wound caused by Judas' defection and there is healing.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But did Jesus really choose Matthias?  Some people feel this whole think was a mistake because
we never hear of Matthias again.  Quite true but that doesn't mean he was a failure or that his
ministry counted for nothing or it was an ill-advised move on the part of those early believers
to find a replacement.  Christ provided Matthias to a wounded and trusting prayer group.
Jesus' choice was no weak link.  He can be counted as a great minister among the 12.  For the
grace of God is this: not that we never hear the name Matthias again in the Bible, but that we
never hear the name Judas Iscariot again.  Christ brings healing.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Maybe this message has been difficult for you because you have been the wounder.  Feel like a
Judas.  But the one who wounds can now bring healing. The grace of God is such that the words
that God used to describe his firm yet gracious love for his people "I have wounded and I will
heal" can be your confession and new intention.
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now we know the purpose for the down time between Ascension and Pentecost.  They were given the
gift of prayerful waiting, the grace of spiritual healing.  We are never without God's grace.
Even if we feel Jesus has left us and even if it seems the Spirit is somehow absent, we are
never without God's healing grace.  Acts 1 is not about a little administrative item, a modest
up-sizing in the human resources dept.  It is about healing.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And we can participate in God's healing of his church.  Words written or spoken heal.  (I
needed to write a healing letter last week!)
Touch, a good hand shake or a hug, heals.  Prayer heals.  Hospitality heals.  Confession heals.
 May Jesus heal through us.
        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The physical body of Christ was wounded for our sins and healed for our forgiveness.  The
resurrected and ascended body of Jesus bears eternal witness to both wounding and healing.
It's the same with his spiritual body the church.  It bears witness to both wounding and
healing.  May the Spirit of Jesus ordain us to the "Order of St. Matthias" and bring through us
his healing to the church.
