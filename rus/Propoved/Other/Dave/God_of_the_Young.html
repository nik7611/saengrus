<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our minds God is old.  Beyond old, he is ancient.
While we may mentally affirm that God exists beyond time, we still link him with well…being
old.  Michelangelo’s masterpiece “The Creation of Adam” in the Cistene Chapel doesn’t help as
he painted God with flowing white hair and beard.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We may think that God prefers older people because they have gotten over things like silliness
and first crushes and education and career decisions and racing hormones and loudness and
pent-up energy and experimentation and idealism, thinking they can be anything, thinking they
can change the world.  Older people may be more to God’s liking.  Old people have time to be
religious.  Your golden years are the perfect time to draw near to God.  There are some notable
seniors in the Bible like Abraham and Sarah who at 100 and 90 years old respectively had a
miracle baby and Moses, who at 80 led the people of Israel out of Egyptian slavery.  But the
Bible shouts out loud that God is not shy or slow about working through younger people and even
young people.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Today we are going to look at a young Jewish girl, one of a number of famous young girls in the
Bible.  Her name is Haddaseh, but if you are familiar with the book of Esther in the Older
Testament, you probably know her as Esther.

<td>She grew up in what is now Iran near the Iran-Iraq border just north of the Persian Gulf in
Susa which was the capital of the Persian Empire in the fifth century B.C. A century earlier,
her people had been brought there by the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezer.  The Babylonians had
fallen to the Persians and now a Persian king named Xerxes was the absolute master of his
empire.  In his empire men were in charge and he was the man among men.  On one occasion, his
queen Vashti refused to follow a direct command.  Wanting to be seen as the ruler of his own
house, he banned her forever from his presence.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let’s pick up the story in

Esther 2:1-11.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“But after Xerxes’ anger had subsided, he began thinking about Vashti and what she had done and
the decree he had made. So his personal attendants suggested, ‘Let us search the empire to find
beautiful young virgins for the king.  Let the king appoint agents in each province to bring
these beautiful young women into the royal harem at the fortress of Susa. Hegai, the king’s
eunuch in charge of the harem, will see that they are all given beauty treatments.  After that,
the young woman who most pleases the king will be made queen instead of Vashti.’ This advice
was very appealing to the king, so he put the plan into effect.
At that time there was a Jewish man in the fortress of Susa whose name was Mordecai son of
Jair. He was from the tribe of Benjamin and was a descendant of Kish and Shimei.  His family
had been among those who, with King Jehoiachin of Judah, had been exiled from Jerusalem to
Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar.  This man had a very beautiful and lovely young cousin,
Hadassah, who was also called Esther. When her father and mother died, Mordecai adopted her
into his family and raised her as his own daughter.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As a result of the king’s decree, Esther, along with many other young women, was brought to the
king’s harem at the fortress of Susa and placed in Hegai’s care.  Hegai was very impressed with
Esther and treated her kindly. He quickly ordered a special menu for her and provided her with
beauty treatments. He also assigned her seven maids specially chosen from the king’s palace,
and he moved her and her maids into the best place in the harem.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Esther had not told anyone of her nationality and family background, because Mordecai had
directed her not to do so.  Every day Mordecai would take a walk near the courtyard of the
harem to find out about Esther and what was happening to her.”

This story sounds like the reality TV show “Bachelor.”  A beautiful girl rises from anonymity
to superstardom from a huge group of hopefuls and one man gets to pick the winner.  But for all
the publicity, Ether is in hiding.  No one knows she is a Jewess.  Now some Jews like Mordecai
had risen to prominence in the Persian Empire, but common sense dictated that you kept quiet
about being a Jew.  Not everyone would be pleased to have Jews gaining power.  So Esther hid
it.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hiding is the original game. We play peek-a-boo with babies.  We play hide and seek when we
were kids that ranged over the whole house and yard or even the entire playground, hiding has
an appeal.  It gives a sense of controlling what is known about us and when it is revealed.  We
hide many things about ourselves that we do not want others to know.  There is a time to hide.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We hide our first names in the telephone book and leave an initial.  We hide our personal
information like passwords and PIN numbers.  We hide keys and other items in certain places for
safety or security reasons.  At times we hide our opinions and thoughts and reactions.
Sometimes the best face to put on is a poker face!  We try to be wise in our relationships as
we slowly reveal more and more of who we are to the other person.  Sometimes we know that there
are things we will keep hidden from the other person because it is not appropriate for that
relationship.  Sometimes we may find ourselves physically hiding from people.  There is a time
to hide.

<td>But there is a time to show your true self, to not hold back, to be vulnerable.  As it says
in Ecclesiastes 3, there is a time to be silent and a time to speak.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Esther was silent all the way through what amounted to a beauty pageant.  All the way through
she was admired by all the officials and eventually won the king’s heart.  He made her the
queen.  She still kept her Jewish identity a secret.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mordecai continued loyally in Xerses’s civil service, once exposing a plot to kill the king.
Everything seemed to be going along well until Mordecai angered a high-ranking Persian noble
named Haman.  Haman planned to kill Mordecai, but when he learned that he was a Jew, a people
whom his ancestors had hated, he thought <strong><em>“Better yet, I will kill all of the Jews
in the entire empire.”</em></strong>
He told the king <strong><em>“There’s a people living in Persia who don’t obey your laws and
should not be tolerated.  I’ll get rid of them for you at my own expense.”</em></strong>  There
would be plenty of people throughout the empire eager to help.  <strong><em>“Do with them as
you please.”</em></strong>  When the word got out about the impending massacre, all the Jews in
the empire, including Mordecai, were beside themselves with grief.  Esther heard of his
distress & sent a servant to find out what was wrong.  She was hidden away in blissful
ignorance in the king’s harem and hadn’t heard the news.
  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Mordecai sent word back about the planned extermination and said she had to go before the king
to plead for her people.  <strong><em>“I can’t do that.  You know what happens to anyone who
approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned.  They’re as good as dead, unless
he holds out his gold scepter and spares them.  And besides it’s been 30 days since he called
for me.”</em></strong>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mordecai’s answer came back.  It was strong.  It was blunt.  It was decisive.  “Don't think
that just because you are the queen and live in the king's house you're the one Jew who will
get out of this alive. If you persist in staying silent at a time like this, help and
deliverance will arrive for the Jews from someplace else; but you and your family will be wiped
out.”  Mordecai appears to believe that a protecting Presence among the Jews (the word “God”
does not appear anywhere in the book) would not allow them to be wiped out and would deal with
those who let it happen.  Then he lightens his tone and wistfully adds “Who knows? Maybe you
were made queen for just such a time as this.”  He was calling her to act, to out herself to
the king.  To come out of hiding.  There is a time to be silent and a time to speak.  A time to
hide and a time to come out of hiding.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Esther replied <strong><em>“You better get everyone to fast for me for three days and then I’ll
go to the king, even though it's forbidden. If I die, I die.”</em></strong>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What happens after those 3 days is nothing short of amazing.  Esther went to the king.  She was
spared.  Esther pleaded with him to spare her people from the man plotting their destruction.
Haman was exposed and executed for his treachery.  Mordecai was promoted to the highest
position in the land next to the king for his loyalty.  The Jews were saved and their enemies
were destroyed.  And Jews the world over celebrate this rescue every year as the Feast of Purim
(March 3 this year).  All this because a young woman came out of hiding when it was time.

<td>Sometimes it is time to hide.  People in the Bible had times when hiding was the smart
thing to do.  David hid in wilderness caves when his enemies were out to kill him.  Hills were
a good place to hide.  But David knew that the mountains provided little protection.  He needed
a better hiding place.
He wrote Psalm 121 1-2 I look up to the mountains; does my help come from mountains?  No, my
help comes from God, who made heaven, and earth, and mountains…He is your Guardian God, right
at your side to protect you.
Psalm 32:7 You are my hiding place; you will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs
of deliverance.
   <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Psalm 143:9  Rescue me from my enemies, O LORD, for I hide myself in you.
Jesus hid on occasion.  John 8:59 - Once when Jesus angered his opponents with something he
said, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple
grounds.  It was not his time.  Right then it was a time to hide.  Maybe you need to hide right
now.  God is not against hiding.  He offers himself as a hiding place.  A place to be quiet and
alone and protected.  Is it time for you to hide?
Or is God calling you out into a new space, to do a new thing, to engage a new sense of
vocation?  To take on an assignment?  To exercise a fledgling spiritual gift?
    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

There is a time to hide and a time to come out of hiding.  Both are actions of trust.
“Retreat!” is as wise as “Charge!”  What time is it for you?  Where are you in some danger and
need to hide believing in God protection?  Where do you need to come out of hiding in surrender
to God’s call?
