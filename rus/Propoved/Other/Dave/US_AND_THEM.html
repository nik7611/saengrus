<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are going to eject two troublemakers out of
Northview Community Church.  I don't know if you are all aware of what these two rascals have
been trying to do, but I want all of us to agree to kick them out today because they are up to
no good.  They will not leave on their own.  They are too stubborn to do that.  They will need
to be removed, perhaps forcibly, and today is the day.  Some of you may know their identities,
others may not.  I am going to out them. Their names are <strong>Us and Them</strong>.
Together, over the course of time, they have begun wars, divided countries, changed neighbours
into combatants, complicated workplaces and split churches.  They are constantly in the news.
And they are often in the pews.  And today we will show them the door.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>"Us and them"</strong> is an old problem.  You put two or more groups of people
together who embody some differences that are said to have significance and the problem
surfaces.  The differences can be the same as they were in Bible times - race, culture,
beliefs, language, gender, age, social standing, education.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>"Us"</strong> and <strong>"them"</strong> were in the early church.  In Acts 6, we find
that there were Jewish believers who spoke Greek and had adopted some expressions of prevailing
Greek culture, and Jewish believers who spoke Hebrew and maintained their own particular Jewish
cultural heritage.  The Greek speaking Jews complained that their widows were being overlooked
in the church's <strong>"meals on wheels"</strong> program.  So the apostles got the church
together and said <strong>"Choose seven faithful people who could look after this.</strong>
The church chose seven people, all with Greek names.  They would do a good job!  It worked
well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But it could be said that they came up with a plan to deal only with the inequity.  There is no
mention of dealing with the underlying problem, which is the relational gap between the two
groups.  That is like paying taxes to help the poor people in our society (which goes toward
addressing the need) but still overlooking them as people to whom we belong and who belong to
us.
  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Living out the love of God would require more than an administrative procedure like appointing
seven people to bring meals to widows as important a ministry as that is.  It would require a
new way of living, a new way of being together that didn't simply perpetuate honouring these
human distinctions.  <strong>"Us"</strong> and <strong>"them"</strong> cannot be administered
out of existence.  <strong>"Us"</strong> and <strong>"them"</strong> are words, but they are
more than words that we speak.  We think them.  We feel them.  We live them.  They betray our
deeply divided humanity.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Paul wrote his letter to the Romans to knit together the church in Rome that had some of these
stresses.  The church in Rome likely began when some Jews as well as converts to Judaism came
to Jerusalem from Rome for the harvest festival called Pentecost, which took place 50 days
after Jesus was raised from the dead.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We read about these visitors from Rome in Acts 2.  They had been there when the apostle Peter
had preached about God's forgiveness and some of them believed.  They went back and began to
spread this news and a church was established.  All of these early believers in Jesus were
Jewish by heredity or choice.  Everything was going along for the church in Rome until A.D. 49.
 The Roman Emperor at the time named Claudius expelled all the Jews from Rome.  This would have
impacted the church which had many Jewish people in it.  It is not certain how thoroughly these
measures were enforced or how long this exile went on (Claudius died in A.D. 54) but by A.D. 57
Jews were back in Rome, and among them Jewish believers in Jesus who came back to their
wonderful Jewish church back in Rome, only to find that in their absence it had become a
predominantly Gentile church.  Things had changed.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Church potluck casseroles had non-kosher meat in them.  People were bringing pork chops and
crab cakes.  Hospitality was a non-starter.  You never knew what they would serve you.  Special
religious days on the calendar went by without so much as a mention in the bulletin.  Seating
patterns in worship services whispered what nobody would say out loud.  Little circumcised
Jewish boys were playing in the church nursery alongside uncircumcised Gentile boys, making
parents uneasy.  In the youth group, young Jewish girls were getting a little too friendly with
young Gentile boys and vice versa and families were on edge.  Some Gentiles felt pressure to
conform to the Jewish way of doing things and some Jews felt they had to surrender to whatever
the Gentiles wanted.  Everything seemed up for grabs & people were getting defensive, and if
not defensive, at least very nervous.  "Well, yes they are our brothers and sisters in Jesus,
butâ€¦they are not us, they're them!"
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A whole bunch of issues were raised.  How do you live in the same spiritual community with
people who seem to be very different from you, or just different enough to make you
uncomfortable?  In Romans 15, after addressing a series of practical matters on how to live
peaceably (things like dietary laws and observing special holy days), Paul finishes off his
appeal for harmony by highlighting the need to come together in Christ for the glory of God.

<td>Romans 15:5-13<br> - May God, who gives patience and encouragement, help you live in
complete harmony with each other, as is fitting for followers of Christ Jesus.  Then all of you
can join together with one voice, giving praise and glory to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Therefore, accept each other just as Christ has accepted you so that God will be given glory.
Remember that Christ came as a servant to the Jews to show that God is true to the promises he
made to their ancestors.  He also came so that the Gentiles might give glory to God for his
mercies to them.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That is what the psalmist meant when he wrote: "For this, I will praise you among the Gentiles;
I will sing praises to your name."  And in another place it is written, "Rejoice with his
people, you Gentiles."  And yet again, "Praise the LORD, all you Gentiles.  Praise him, all you
people of the earth."  And in another place Isaiah said, "The heir to David's throne will come,
and he will rule over the Gentiles.  They will place their hope on him."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I pray that God, the source of hope, will fill you completely with joy and peace because you
trust in him. Then you will overflow with confident hope through the power of the Holy Spirit.

<tr class="w1text">
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul starts with God, not us, for our only hope to live
in harmony with each other lies in God.  May the God who gives patient endurance and
encouragement give you a spirit of Christian unity as you follow Jesus so that with one heart
and one mouth you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We are to get along with each other for God's glory.  Jesus lived for the glory of his Father
out of one undivided heart and one unmixed mouth.  And we are Jesus' apprentices.  His one
heart for God and his one mouth of praise to God have become our one heart and our one mouth
that we use in the praise of God.
We are to reach out and welcome one another, accept, embrace, receive each other into our
lives.  Paul gives a definition of what such acceptance looks like: just like Jesus reached out
and welcomed you into his life.  When Jesus drew you into his life so that you participate
fully in it, did it matter to him what colour you were?  What language you spoke?  What race
you came from?  What culture shaped your life?  What food you ate?  What age you were?  What
intelligence you enjoyed?  What social status you had?  What gender you were?  What sins you
were guilty of?  All these things were meaningless in terms of his welcome.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Accept one another in Jesus Christ so that God is glorified.  Jesus came to fulfill God's
ancient promises, his ancestral covenant to the Jewish patriarchs, which was a promise to also
include the Gentiles in God's mercy so that we could all praise God together.  The historic
promises made to Abraham can be summed up in these words: <strong>"I will bless you and make
you a great nation and all peoples of the earth will be blessed through you."</strong>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So this is not just organizational wisdom Paul is addressing, but the fulfillment of ancient
promises, the realization of a divine covenant established thousands of years ago.  This is
what psalmist David meant in Psalm 18 about glorifying God which is the point!  <strong>"I will
praise you among the Gentiles."</strong>  An insider soloist is glorifying God in the presence
of outsiders.  And in another place, in a song that Moses sang in Deut 32 <strong>"Rejoice with
his people, you Gentiles."</strong>  Outsiders and insiders praise God together!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And in Psalm 117, the shortest psalm in Bible, we read <strong>"Praise the LORD, all you
Gentiles.  Praise him, all you people of the earth."</strong>  And in another place Isaiah
said, <strong>"The heir to David's throne (Jesus) will come, and he will rule over the
Gentiles"</strong> for they will be included in his kingdom of love.  <strong>"They will place
their hope on him."</strong>  Jew and Gentile belong together in hope and praise.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What about us?  Where can we look for the uniting gift of God to show itself among us?  How can
his ancient promises of a united humanity be fulfilled in this place, at this time?  Among
people like us, White Anglo Saxon, many Russian and Ukranian immigrants, people from South
America and Asia and the far East, Africa and the islands?
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Romans gives us some clues as to how this transformation can show itself.  Ch. 16 is one of the
warmest touches in the letter to the Romans with its cascade of personal greetings. By the way,
there are more Greek and Roman names than Jewish names in these blessings.  Some of the names
sound strange and are difficult to say.

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say hello to Priscilla and Aquila, who have worked hand
in hand with me in serving Jesus. They once put their lives on the line for me. And I'm not the
only one grateful to them. All the Gentile gatherings of believers also owe them plenty, to say
nothing of the church that meets in their house.

who live with them.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Holy embraces all around! All the churches of Christ send their warmest greetings!...And here
are some more greetings from our end. Timothy, my partner in this work, Lucius, and my cousins
Jason and Sosipater all said to tell you hello.  I, Tertius, who wrote this letter at Paul's
dictation, send you my personal greetings.  Gaius, who is host here to both me and the whole
church, wants to be remembered to you.  Erastus, the city treasurer, and our good friend
Quartus send their greetings.

<tr class="w1text">
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul greeted people by name.  There is an invitation here for
us to learn each other's names.  Names are important.  Learn three new names before you leave
this morning and write them down and memorize them so you can use them next week.  And do more
next week and week after that until you know them all.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then there are the greetings themselves.  Paul urges them to greet one another with a holy
kiss, a kiss of peace (16:16).  We may not need to greet each other that way, but we can offer
each other warm Christian greetings and a sincere handshake.  Look into the eyes of the person
as you speak words of warm greeting.  Take the initiative.  You will never know how much it
means to the other person.  I remember going to St. John's Convent once and one of the sisters
there greeted me with a heartfelt "Hello David" and I felt valued and instantly at home.
  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then there I hospitality.  The heart of God is the heart of hospitality.  In Romans 16, we read
<strong>"Receive Phoebe,"</strong> and <strong>"Gaius whose hospitality I and the whole church
enjoy"</strong> One of the things Paul addressed in chapter 14 was table fellowship, a sign of
hospitality.  Eat together.  It doesn't need to be extravagant.  One friendship that we have
enjoyed for twenty years started out with a Sunday lunch of cheese, crackers and grapes.  Bring
sandwiches and share them with someone.  Plan to host an evening and invite people who need to
be introduced.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The cross is not just about your personal salvation, our being reconciled to God.  While that
is of huge importance and I urge everyone here to give themselves over to the accepting heart
of Jesus, it is about more than that.  God also desires our salvation as a re-united humanity.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Listen to Ephesians 2 - <strong>"For Christ himself has brought peace to us. He united Jews and
Gentiles into one people when, in his own body on the cross, he broke down the wall of
hostility that separated us.  He made peace between Jews and Gentiles by creating in himself
one new people from the two groups.  Together as one body, Christ reconciled both groups to God
by means of his death on the cross, and our hostility toward each other was put to
death."</strong>  What we have happening here is the gospel - the gospel is not only about
being reconciled with God but with each other!  The gospel signals the end of
<strong>"us"</strong> and <strong>"them."</strong>  When we live in the Spirit of Christ,
dealing with each other is not about <strong>"us"</strong> dealing with
<strong>"them."</strong>  It never is.  We belong to each other in the peace of Christ.  This
is the gospel.  This is the glory of God.
  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We have been invited into peace and in the strength of that peace we will do what I said we
would at the beginning of the message.  We will eject <strong>"us"</strong> and
<strong>"them."</strong>  Are you ready to do the deed?  Join me.  <strong>"Us and them,
wherever you are in this building and in our own hearts, get out in the name of Jesus our Lord,
don't ever darken the doorway of Northview ever again, we reject you; we don't ever want to see
you back or hear from you ever again.  Be gone, to the glory of God!  Amen."</strong>
