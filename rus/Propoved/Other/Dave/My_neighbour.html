<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is my neighbour?  Is someone my neighbour if
I know their names?  Are neighbours determined by postal codes, addresses?  By social
demographics?
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Does the word neighbour seem to be stretched thin if the person is from some other country or
culture or speaks another language or dresses differently or keeps their property differently
than mine or has a faith different than mine or lives their life in a way that distresses or
offends me?
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We live in a world where we may not know our neighbours.  We may be afraid of our neighbours.
We hear news reports of crimes and tragedies that have happened in various neighbourhoods and
people who live beside or near them are shocked to have a neighbour arrested.  We see police
cars down the street and wonder <strong>"Who is my neighbour?"</strong>  I'm not sure I want to
find out.  Maybe they run a grow op.  This week, officers discovered 22 apartment grow-ops
scattered throughout nine floors of one 13-storey highrise in the west end.  Those who live in
the building were shocked as they watched police haul out eight truckloads of drug
paraphernalia such as lamps, fans and electronic devices.  One man said "It's really terrible
to hear what actually went on here."  A woman said "I am so worried because I have two kids, my
daughter is 13, my son is 17.  And you worry, you know?"  Who, in fact, is my neighbour?  Who
is your neighbour?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is a good thing to talk to Jesus about.  Thankfully, one person actually did ask Jesus about
this.  Who is my neighbour?  Let's read about this conversation.

<td><strong><em>READ Luke 10:25-37.(KJV)</em></strong><br>
 25 And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to
inherit eternal life?
<br>
 26 He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?
<br>
 27 And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all
thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.
<br>
 28 And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.

<br>
 29 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?
<br>
 30 And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among
thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half
dead.
<br>
 31 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by
on the other side.
<br>
 32 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on
the other side.
<br>
 33 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had
compassion on him,
<br>
 34 And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own
beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.

<br>
 35 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and
said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will
repay thee.
<br>
 36 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the
thieves?
<br>
 37 And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou
likewise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The conversation started out by the man asking Jesus what he should do to inherit eternal life.
 This was not as innocent a question as it appeared to be.  He was actually testing Jesus.
This man was a religious lawyer, a Torah scholar, an expert in the Jewish Law, who had some
pretty definite ideas about almost everything.  He is like us.  Eternal life was a common
Jewish theological topic.  Rabbis would debate this.  This teacher wanted to see if the kingdom
of God that Jesus was preaching was in line with the kingdom that he and his other expert
friends were teaching.  He chose a critical question.  What must I do to inherit eternal life,
to enjoy the life of God?  Jesus answers in effect - you're the specialist.  What does the
Jewish law, the Torah, say?  How do you understand it?"
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>"Love God with all your heart, all your soul, all your strength and all your mind and
love your neighbour as deeply as you do your own self."  "Good answer.  You're right."</strong>
Jesus replied.  This is what the life of God is all about.  Then Jesus does the unexpected.  He
cares for the man.  He broke the rules of debate and left the world of ideas and opinions in
which the lawyer felt at home and talked about the man's life.  <strong>"Do this and you will
live."</strong>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Jesus has made the conversation about what this man does, his actions, his life not his ideas
or religious statement of faith.  The man now wants to make sure that the definition of
"neighbour" agrees with how he is already living and loving.  He wants God's commands on his
own terms.  He is trying to domesticate the law instead of letting it run loose in his life.
He is like us because we are experts in the Bible.  When we run across the some of the radical
words of God that would cause us huge inconvenience if we were to take them at face value, we
look for explanations that appear to reinforce and agree with our thoughts on the matter.  Our
question may be <strong>"Who is my brother?"</strong>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<strong>Matt 5 - "So if you are presenting a sacrifice at the altar in the Temple and you
suddenly remember you're your brother has something against you, leave your sacrifice there at
the altar. Go and be reconciled to your brother. Then come and offer your sacrifice to God.  We
look at that and think: Brother?  Male family member?  Sisters?  Church family?  All
Christians?  World?  If it means world I would never stop making things right with people whom
my life wrongs in some way or other and God would never get his sacrifice!  Or maybe such a
far-reaching reconciliation is the sacrifice he desires!  Instead of debating neighbour or
brother, listen with your heart.</strong>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Henri Nouwen says "To take the Holy Scriptures and read them is the first thing we have to do
to open ourselves to God's call.  Reading the Scriptures is not as easy as it seems, since in
our academic world we tend to make anything and everything we read subject to analysis and
discussion. But the word of God should lead us first of all to contemplation and meditation.
Instead of taking the words apart, we should bring them together in our innermost being;
instead of wondering whether we agree or disagree, we should wonder which words are directly
spoken to us and connect directly with our most personal story.  Instead of thinking about the
words as potential subjects for an interesting dialogue or paper, we should be willing to let
them penetrate into the most hidden corners of our heart, even to those places where no other
word has yet found entrance.  Then and only then can the word bear fruit as seed sown in rich
soil."
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In response to Jesus' <strong>"Do this and you will live"</strong>, this religion scholar feels
vulnerable and so he throws another question at Jesus, a technical question to argue about, a
definition of neighbour.  Who exactly is <strong>"my neighbour"</strong>?  Sometimes we ask
questions just to put off going to work as Jesus' apprentices.  The time for questions is over.
 The time for restrictive definitions is over.  The time for imaginative mercy is here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We live in a world that likes to define everything, thinking that if we define something we
really know what it is.  When Jesus was asked to give a definition of the term <strong>"my
neighbour"</strong>, he didn't nail the term down with a verbal description that could be found
in a dictionary or hold up in a court of law.  Instead, he used his imagination and came up
with a parable for life in this world, a story we know as the Parable of the Good Samaritan.
Borrowing on something that preacher William Willimon said, the parable of the good Samaritan
is a story let loose in the world of the imagination of God.  The story went like thisâ€¦


</td></tr>
<tr class="w1text">
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man was traveling from Jerusalem in the Judean
highlands to Jericho in the Jordan River Valley.  On his journey, he was attacked by some
robbers.  They took his clothes, as they were all he had of value, and left him half dead
beside the road.  After a while, a priest came down the same road.  Surely he would be filled
with concern for the man.  But he passes by without stopping, going over to the other side of
the road.  Then, after a while, a Levite, a temple assistant, came down the road, but he too
ignored the man.  Then, even later, a man from Samaria came upon the man.  The very word
Samaritan was like a curse word.  There was nothing good about Samaritans.  The scholar might
well have called this The Parable of the Lousy Samaritan, the Parable of the Cursed Samaritan.
The Jews and Samaritan had deep seated hostility toward each other.  Historically, suspicion,
prejudice, hatred and even violence marked their relationship.  What will he do to the man?
Why, he may even have the urge to kick a Jew when he was down.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

He saw the man and had compassion on him.  He went over to where he lay, knelt down and began
cleaning his wounds with wine and applied healing oils and covered them with bandages.  He
lifted him up and put him on his donkey and took him to an inn and cared for him, watching him
all through the night.  In the morning, he gave the innkeeper some money and said "Take care of
him.  If it costs you more than this, I'll pay up when I come back."  A heart-warming story.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Then Jesus asks the religion scholar a question.  Now which of the three passersby would you
say was a neighbour to the victim?  Hold on!  That is not what the man asked about!  His
question was about the identity of his neighbour, the person whom he ought to love.  Jesus
comes at the identity of the neighbour from another angle, who was the neighbour to the victim?
 Jesus rules the scholar's question irrelevant, useless and wrongheaded.  He never answers it.
The only question that remains is "Who was a neighbour to the victim?"  Jesus talks only about
showing love.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The answer is obvious to the religion scholar.  <strong>"The one who showed him
mercy."</strong>  <br>

The question of loving one's neighbour is never a question about the identity of the neighbour
but about one's own actions.  The issue is never, ever about the identity of my neighbour, as
if I should love the person who fits the definition, but can ignore the one who falls outside
the definition.  Life of God is always about demonstrating love.  Don't merely define.
Demonstrate.  Or as Jesus ends the conversation <strong>"Do."</strong>   You be the Samaritan.
Do what he did.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The fact that the one who showed mercy was a Samaritan sharpens the point and drives it home.
Here was a person who reached across the boundaries set up by centuries of human animosity, the
deep religious, racial and cultural division between two peoples, and treated someone the way
he would treat himself.  He ignored any limiting definitions of neighbour and reached out in
imaginative love.  Imagine this kind of love let loose in our world, in our neighbourhoods.
People reaching across all the divisions.  Sometimes the world today is described as a "global
village" where instant communication ties all of our lives together.  Jesus calls us to imagine
the world as a neighbourhood where deeds of mercy bind us all together.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In order to be a good Samaritan in the news today you just have to help a stranger, someone
with whom you have no personal ties, a neutral encounter.  Perhaps we have never lived out this
parable in our own lives until we help the people whom, by all accounts, we might loathe.  Or,
on the other hand, receive help from people we may be tempted to loathe!
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Does this expert <strong>"go and live like that"</strong>?  Maybe. He could dismiss what Jesus
has said.  After all, he was the expert!   But he might begin to live with imagination.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We have our questions about compassion fatigue.  What about when you're half dead from
Samaritanizing?!  Even the  compassionate Samaritan enlisted others and if they needed cash
incentives he gave it.  What about if there is danger?  What about being taken in by someone?
What if when the Samaritan left the man in the inn, he went wild with room service and racked
up a huge bill?  There is always risk with love.  Be discerning, but understand that love opens
you to loss.  But ultimately, to more gain than loss.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We can have a border-less love.  God can move you to the place where you will have his enormous
imagination and say to the world around you "I will love you regardless of your age, your
gender, your race or ethnic background, your religious beliefs, your sexual orientation, your
social status, your disability, your IQ, your wealth, your diseases or conditions, your outward
appearance, regardless of your sin and regardless of any personal disdain you may have toward
me.  In this parable, we celebrate the triumph of mercy, of love, of compassion.  Mercy
triumphs over all our differences.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We began by asking <strong>"Who is my neighbour?"</strong>  <strong>"Well Jesus, who is my
neighbour?"</strong> <br> He replies, <strong>"Don't even ask the question.  Just love.  Have
mercy.  Be compassionate.  Be a neighbour."  </strong>
