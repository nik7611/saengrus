<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in Bible College in the 70's, I was part of
a male quartet that traveled to churches representing the school.  One day I was with the dean
getting some promotional material together to leave at the church we were going to that weekend
and he saw me take a whole pile of pamphlets and said <strong>"You can put some back.  We don't
want to be prodigal with them."</strong>  Prodigal?  The only place I knew that word from was
from one of the parables that Jesus told that had come to be known as the Parable of the
Prodigal Son.  A son took his cut of his father's estate and spent it in wild living and then
came crawling back to daddy when he was broke.  Did the dean think that I would run off with
these pamphlets and wildly litter the streets with them?  I asked him what prodigal meant?
<strong>"Wasteful."</strong>  Ah, too many pamphlets means many would be wasted.  The young man
wasted his share of his father's estate.  So we could call Jesus' story The Parable of the
Wasteful Son.
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Parables are stories with surprises in them that challenge and confront us.  Jesus told this
parable to a mixed crowd.  Pharisees and teachers of the Jewish law were the religious leaders
of the day.  Tax collectors were Jews who chose to work for the hated Gentile Roman Empire and
tax their own people.  Many were crooked and over-taxed their fellow Jews and pocketed the
difference.  <strong>"Sinners"</strong> is a word that the religious people used to refer to
prostitutes and other people who broke the Jewish law in some way.  These people were eager to
listen to Jesus and he always welcomed them openly when they came.
  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Pharisees and teachers of the law thought this to be terrible, and if that wasn't bad
enough, Jesus went to the extreme of religious bad taste-he even ate with them, which was a
sign of acceptance and relationship.  Religious leaders avoided these kind of people and so to
think of sitting down and actually eating with them was beyond their imagination.  It would
never happen.  So Jesus told three parables, the lost sheep, the lost coin, we will look at the
last one, the Parable of the Prodigal or Wasteful Son.
    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A man had two sons.  One day, the younger son says "Give me my share of your estate.<strong>"
It would be his when his father died, but he couldn't wait for his father to die and wanted it
sooner than later.  We could call this the Parable of the Terribly Impatient Son.  </strong>
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
His father said "Okay" and handed over to the younger son his whole inheritance. Bad decision!
What was the father thinking?!  We can see where this is going!  Giving it all to him in one
lump sum was a foolish thing to do.  Maybe we should rename it the Parable of the
Prodigal/Wasteful Father/ or the Foolish Father!
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A few days later, the younger son gathered all of his inheritance together and went to a
country far away from dad and home.  Is anyone surprised?!  No, we could all see this coming!
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Off he went, maybe to Antioch or Corinth or perhaps Rome, ah yes Rome, the big apple, that
would be great.  He started flashing his money around, throwing it and himself into everything
decadent that money could buy.  I guess it is the Parable of the Wasteful Son.  This son makes
us angry.  So self-centred and disrespectful of his father.  Perhaps the only mercy that he
showed his dad is that he went far away to live this way.  While we still hold the father
responsible for his bad decision, we want the son to get what's coming to him.  Can't wait for
him to fall.
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We don't have to wait long; money can only take you so far.  And he only had so much of it.
Eventually, it ran out.  If that wasn't bad enough, a severe food shortage hit that country,
perhaps from drought or some infestation, and he began to suffer the effects of starvation.  In
desperation, he went to a local Gentile pig farmer who sent him out to feed pigs.  The pig food
even started to look tasty to him because neither the farmer nor anyone else would give him
anything to eat.  The farmer should have fed him but didn't.  It was wrong, but it happens.
Looks good on you!  Welcome to the real world!
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The real world is a harsh teacher and he soon comes to his senses.  Hold on here!  The hired
servants in my father's house have more food then they can eat and here I am dying of hunger.
I'm going to go home to my father and say <strong>"Father, I've sinned against God, I've sinned
before you; I don't deserve to be called your son any more. Take me on as a hired
servant."</strong>  Hired servants had a harder lot than slaves, because their employment was
more uncertain.  Slaves were property and could be sure of food and shelter, but hired servants
could be let go.  He was going to suggest the lowest, most tenuous relationship with the man
who was his father.
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He plans every word carefully because his life depends on it.  His confession is designed to
change what may be the hard heart of a bitter father.  We may say <strong>"Humph!  He's only
coming home because he's hungry!  If he had unlimited money he never would have come back!
Some repentance!  He's still trying to use his father!"</strong>  We should call this the
Parable of the Con Artist.  Maybe.  Maybe not.  He left the pigs and started the journey toward
home.  He was still a way off from the farm, barely a speck in the distance, when his father
saw him.  It almost seems like he was waiting.  Maybe that's why some call it the Parable of
the Waiting Father.  Instead of watching his son make the last part of the journey home, the
father forgets about dignity and expectations and starts running and soon reaches his son and
grabs him in a huge hug and kisses him.  The son starts into his planned speech.

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never got a chance to finish his confession.  His
father was already giving orders to the servants <strong>"Quick! Bring the robe reserved for
honoured guests.  Put the family ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Only slaves go
around barefoot. Then get a choice fat calf!  We're going to have the mother of all BBQs!  My
son is here-he was once dead but now he's alive! Lost and now found!"</strong> And they began
to have a great party, filled with music and dancing.
  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now somewhere along here we forgive the father for his earlier bad judgement and the son as
well for his foolishness.  We are glad to have him back.  And we think to ourselves
<strong>"What a wonderful little story!  No surprise that it is loved by so many!"</strong>
That why some have suggested we call it the Parable of the Wonderful Father.  But it's not
over.  Jesus the story teller will not let us off that easy.
       <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There was the older son.  Just like his brother, he too had been out in the fields working.
Like his brother, he too was returning home, probably for a good meal, just like his brother.
When he came within earshot of the house, he heard the party.  He called a servant
<strong>"What's going on at the house?"</strong>  <strong>"Your brother's back and your father
is so happy that he's throwing a party."  </strong>
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The older brother, probably after the initial shock wears off, is filled with anger.  He
refuses to go into the house.  His father came out.  Come on in Son, please.  Your brother's
home.  Please.  We feel sorry for the father.
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The older brother shot back <strong>"Look!  I've been faithfully slaving away here for you all
these years.  I never disobeyed anything you said, kept all the rules, did all you asked.
Never once in all that time did you even give me one lousy little goat so that I and my friends
could have a party.  But no sooner has this son of yours come home after throwing away your
money in who knows how many brothels, you fall all over yourself to arrange for an all out
feast with our best beef.  I don't understand you!"</strong>  Okay, the brothels might be his
idea, but he is rightfully angry.  And who can blame him?  I can't.  I would be angry too.
Know why?  I was a good kid.  I was obedient.  Ask my parents. I never went through a
rebellious phase as a teenager.  I just went through without raising a fuss.  I was
conscientious.  I was a good son.  I was this son.  So I know where this son is coming from.
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now, if we believe this son, and we have no reason not to, the father is back in the dog house.
 He never showed any appreciation for the hard work of his son?  This is a dream son!  Parents
would give their right arm for a child like this.
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you could choose between having rebellious children who cause you enormous pain and children
who are hard-working and obedient, which would you choose?  And you'd probably be better than
this father who couldn't even show his appreciation with a little recognition?  We suspect that
the father deserves this rebuke by his son.  This son had been living in a far country of sorts
even while under his father's roof!  This is no way to manage a family, to heap attention on
the rebellious and overlook the loyal.  We all know this!  Is this the Parable of the Lousy
Father?  Or maybe we should call it the Parable of the Lost Sons because they both suffer
alienation from their father at different points in the story.  Or maybe it is the Parable of
the Family Meltdown.
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What can the father say in response to that?   Son, he starts, you are always here with me and
everything I have is yours.  (We'll give him the benefit of the doubt that he is not saying
<strong>"You're always here,"</strong> as in being taken for granted.)  So you could have at
any time you wanted gotten any of my goats or a calf for that matter and had a party.  You
could have done this, but you didn't.  Maybe this is the Parable of the Father Who Just Doesn't
Get It!  He goes on: But we had to celebrate this great occasion of your brother's return.  He
was once dead but now he's alive! Lost and now found!"
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hold it, that's the same line that the father used on the servants.  Here he is treating his
younger rebellious son who would have been content to be a hired servant like a true son and he
is treating his true son like one of his servants.  How about the Parable of the Father whose
attention was wrapped up in his newly returned rebellious son instead of the son who was right
under his nose doing what he was supposed to be doing all along.  This is a difficult story.
There are points in it where we are not too crazy about any of the three characters!
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We love the story when we are the prodigal child, the one who has made a mess of our lives.
But we start to feel uncomfortable if we are good and well-behaved and hard-working and the
no-good one of the family gets the beef!  Amazing grace feels like enraging grace sometimes.
When sinners come crawling back to God after they've blown it and he accepts them with
outrageous joy and celebration in a way that it seems he never has for us and he wants us so be
as glad as he is, that is hard.  And all he has to say in response sounds like a lame
<strong>"I can't help it.  I'm just so happy about your brother's return!"</strong>
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the last few days a sad story has surfaced.  Ted Haggard, who has been the president of the
National Association of Evangelicals in the US, a very public and influential position that
speaks, so they say,  for 33 million evangelical American Christians and the pastor of a
massive church in Colorado Springs, has just been released from those two positions.
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Allegations about purchasing drugs and hiring a male prostitute are swirling about and he has
admitted to some guilt although it is still hazy as to what happened.   He has confessed to
sinfulness and has asked for forgiveness.  He is the prodigal.
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are many older sons who are watching this return and wondering where it will go.
Fully-devoted followers of Jesus who have worked long and hard for the Lord, who have been
faithful and obedient, serving sacrificially without reward or recognition.  There are
thousands and thousands of them for every one Ted Haggard.  They have only brought people to
faith in Christ.  Many may abandon the faith because of Ted Haggard.  They have a good
reputation in their circles.  Ted Haggard, a shredded one, in the world press.  They bring
glory to God, not pain.  They make the job of the church easier.  Ted Haggard just made it
harder for us all.  Hardworking people build up the church.  Prodigals wear it down.  But God
is so happy to have him back.  Is God as happy with what I did for him this week?  Last week?
The week before that?  For the last three years?  Is God happier with the return of a sinner
than he is with my lifetime of serving?
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Part of me suspects that in a few years Ted may return to public ministry in some form, have
numerous speaking engagements and write a book about his experiences which will do well and
will enjoy all the wonderful BBQ'd beef he desires until he dies at a ripe old age, enjoying
his heavenly Father's grace.
It happens over and over again, where prodigals who have messed up in the worst ways, come back
and enjoy God's amazing grace and get to tell the great stories.  And the rest of us, who just
keep going on faithfully like we always have without much applause at all, are invited by Jesus
to enjoy the music and the dancing and the beef at a party held for someone who wasted their
life, but has returned.
   <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In this passage, Jesus comes to me and says <strong>"Dave I'm holding a banquet in Ted's honour
because he's back.  Come and share my joy."</strong>  And I'm standing outside the Father's
home wondering whether to go in or not.  And I have this thought: At the end of the story, who
lost his way?  The only person who lost his way in this story is the responsible person, the
older son.  I don't want to lose my way.
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We have had many people leave this church recently, leaders who gathered up all their money and
abilities and contributions and have ended up in another church home enjoying God's grace.
They are enjoying new friends, new opportunities, new experiences, a fresh start.  But we have
stayed behind continuing to serve here at Northview.  Sometimes our faithfulness can become
mean-spirited and resentful.  Jesus calls us to celebrate his grace to them and take delight in
them as he delights in them.
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the telling of this parable, Jesus actually hands the Pharisees and the teachers of the law
invitations to his next get together with all the sinners the religious leaders resent.  Tax
collectors will be there and sinners and prostitutes and prodigals and Gentile pig farmers and
delirious fathers.  <strong>"Come and be happy with my Father who is beside himself with joy
that they are home.  Be as happy as God is."</strong>  In my retelling of this parable, Jesus
has handed an invitation to each on of you today.  R. S.V.P.  Will you go?  In a miracle of
grace, when we show up to celebrate God's grace to younger brothers, we find ourselves guests
of honour as well.  Maybe we should call it the Parable of the Father's Invitation to all of
us.
