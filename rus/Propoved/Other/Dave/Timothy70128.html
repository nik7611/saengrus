<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not what you would call a daredevil.  I don't
bungee jump or sky-dive.  I like to do new things and I don't mind doing some things that have
an element of risk to them but I don't tend to push the limits too hard.  There are some people
who love to do that.  They are up for anything intensely physical, anything extreme or even
dangerous.  But not me.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Most of the challenges that I face test me in ways other than physical endurance or
psychological toughness.  But they are demanding because they deal with people.  <br><div
align="center"><em>Difficult conversations.  <br>Complex situations.  <br>Massive egos.
<br>Brittle egos.  <br>Uncontrolled reactions.  <br>Deep brokenness.  <br>Spiritual darkness.
<br>The struggle to believe.  <br>Crushing disappointment.  <br>Fierce resistance.  <br>Diverse
personalities.  <br>Rampant confusion.</em></div>  <br>When doing the right thing will cost
dearly.  And frankly, it takes more from me than I have to give.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is those kinds of things that sometimes are too much for you as well right?  And when there
is a lot of it going on around you, you feel like you are in the deep end of the pool-in way
over your head.

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timothy felt like he was in over his head.  And being
timid by nature, as he seemed to be, didn't make it any easier!  Timothy was the apostle Paul's
young associate.  He had been hand picked by Paul on one of his missionary journeys through
Timothy's hometown.  The believers there couldn't say enough good things about Timothy and so
Paul decided to take him with him.  Timothy traveled around with Paul a few years gaining
experience and growing up in his faith.  At one point, they were in Ephesus working with the
church there.  It was experiencing some problems with people who were spreading destructive
ideas.  Paul had to leave and so told Timothy to stay there and quote "stop them."
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Over the course of time that Timothy was there Paul wrote him two letters, 1st and 2nd Timothy
to give him guidance and to encourage him in this tough assignment.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Here's a bit from the second letter. 1:3-7:  Timothy, <strong><em>I thank God for you-the God I
serve with a clear conscience, just as my ancestors did.  Night and day I constantly remember
you in my prayers.  I long to see you again, for I remember your tears as we parted. And I will
be filled with joy when we are together again.
I remember your genuine faith, for you share the faith that first filled your grandmother Lois
and your mother, Eunice. And I know that same faith continues strong in you.  This is why I
remind you to fan into flames the spiritual gift God gave you when I laid my hands on you.  For
God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and
self-discipline.</em></strong>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With these words Paul encourages young Timothy is his task which was to stop the people who
were spreading ideas that opposed what Paul had taught.  Now there may be some people who
respond to this by saying "Here's another classic case of the church bullying people and trying
to shut down opinions that they don't like.  Another instance of the powerbrokers of the church
trying to shut up people who want to explore other ideas.  That's how it works according to the
Da Vinci code conspiracy.  Stomp out ideas and alternatives and options that go against what
you want people to believe.  Church is all about controlling and manipulating people,
controlling what you think, directing what you believe.  Why not just love each other and leave
each other alone?
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Need to consider that Paul was trying to protect the church from ideas not simply because they
were different or new but because of what they produced in people.  The gospel of God's love in
Jesus produced people of faith and love.  Paul wanted the church to be a place where loved
reigned supreme and where people would live with interior purity and freedom and strong faith.
These new teachings would destroy faith and love and enslave people and that's why Paul was
against them.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Listen:  <strong><em>"The purpose of my instruction is that all believers would be filled with
love that comes from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and genuine faith.  But some people have
missed this whole point. They have turned away from these things, trying to make a name for
themselves."</em></strong>  Paul wasn't down on free thinkers per se, but he was against
destructive teaching that didn't help people live out the life of faith in God in love.

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timothy felt intimidated by this task.  He lacked
courage.  Maybe he was tempted to be nice as opposed to helpful.  Maybe he hoped the problem
would go away on its own.  Maybe he wanted to quit.  His anxiety could have come from many
sources.  It was a hard task on its own.   There were some powerful individuals to deal with,
people who were older than he was.  At one point Paul encourages Timothy <strong><em>"Don't let
anyone think less of you because you are young."</em></strong>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
His personality?  Timothy may not have had a presence that commanded respect.
Perhaps his home situation had been influential this way.  We are told in Acts that 16 that
Timothy came form a mixed home, maybe even a mixed up home.  His father was a Greek and his
mother was Jewish.  His mother Eunice was a believer in Jesus as the Messiah as was her mother
Lois, but Timothy's father was not.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Two parents with two different ways of life and Timothy caught in the middle.  How to respect
your father and follow the faith of your mother?  Did his dad make it tough?  Did this
potentially difficult home life cause any insecurity in Timothy?  It wouldn't be the first
time.  Brought this weakness into his faith and ministry.  We always bring who we are into what
we do.  Our doing is filled with our being. <br>
Paul is saying <em>"Timothy I want you to focus on the good things that God has given you
through your home life, from your mother and grandmother.  They have been full of faith in
their lives and have given you a great start in life.  They taught you the Scriptures from an
early age.  Their faith enabled them to live well and face all their challenges in life.  Faith
found a home in your granny's heart and your mother's heart & I am convinced it lives in you
now.  Timothy, it's your turn now. </em>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Stir up in your heart the work of the Spirit, the gift of God that you received when I laid
hands on you.  This would have been some apostolic or pastoral gift, the ability to serve Jesus
in a specific way.  This verse invites us to use our gifts to participate in what God is doing.
 Timothy probably had a sense of the gift that he received. Paul may have even spoken about the
gift or given a prophecy about Timothy that pointed to the nature of the gift as he laid hands
on Timothy.  It is not always as clear to us.

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul was saying <em>"Don't be afraid to use your gift
Timothy even if it is a difficult role."</em>  Then this great statement <em>"For God has not
given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline." </em> That is
a great truth.  Courage is a response to God's Spirit within us.  The Holy Spirit that God has
given to us is not a Spirit that causes us to give in to our insecurities and anxieties.  He is
not a <em>"You can't do that"</em> Spirit, always rubbing our noses in our limitations to keep
us in line.  It is his pleasure to make us capable for the task.  He is the Spirit of power.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He enables you to fulfill the tasks that your gifts qualify you to assume & that God calls you
to do.  It's important to understand that power always has parameters.  <br>
We hear today that one of the greatest things that we can say to children is <em>"You can do
anything!"</em>  We understand the potential that lies within children and we want to encourage
that.  It certainly seems appropriate to encourage children to dream big.  On the other hand,
it may not be totally realistic to say <em>"You can do anything!"</em>  Anything?  I want to
create a new star.  I want to swim to England.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Later on, many of us understand that <em>"You can do anything"</em> doesn't always fit with
human limitations.  Perhaps it would be better if people said <em>"You can do something.  Now
go and do it!"</em>  Maturity & time teach us another layer of wisdom: I will do what I can.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But there is another path, the way of deepest wisdom that God has always pointed to and led us
into: <strong>"I will do what the Lord gives me power to do."</strong>  SAY IT: I will do what
the Lord gives me power to do.  Paul is saying.  Timothy, the Holy Spirit of power gives you
courage among people who have only their own power.  <br>
Not unqualified power.  God's power is always exercised in love.  He is the Spirit of love.  We
tend to think of loving people as gentle and soft.  That is to misread love.  To romanticize
it.  Dietrich Bonhoeffer knew about love.  Bonhoeffer was a young courageous Lutheran
theologian who offered one of the first clear voices of resistance to Adolf Hitler.  Bonhoeffer
openly challenged his church to stand with the Jews in their time of need.  He was a great
examples of moral courage in the face of extreme difficulty and danger."  This is what he wrote
about love.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<em>"The people who love, because they are freed (from themselves) through the truth of God,
are the most revolutionary people on earth.  They are the ones who upset all values; they are
the explosives in human society.  Such persons are the most dangerous." </em> Love for God &
people gives us the power to stand against great difficulty & challenge.  It is like Paul is
saying to Timothy <strong><em>"In this situation of dangerous doctrines, let love make you the
dangerous one.  People who are not concerned with themselves can be free to be dangerous on
behalf of others.  People who have been liberated from self-centeredness are dangerous to the
small people who are only wrapped up in themselves."</em></strong>  The Spirit of love gives
courage.<br>
Moves us to do dangerous things.  While I would not go after a wild animal for no reason, I
would attack it if it were after one of my children.  Love breeds courage.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He is the Spirit of self-discipline.  Sound mind - clear disciplined thinking and living.
This does not come naturally to younger people.  It is something that deepens over time spent
living with God.   Read Proverbs.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Paul tells Timothy in another place to <strong><em>"Flee the evil desires of
youth."</em></strong>  Tis is usually seen as a reference to illicit and destructive sexual
activity (Perhaps, but sexual sin is no respecter of ages).  I think it may refer to the
temptation that young people experience, the temptation to think they know it all or at least
know more than older people.  I know what you younger people are thinking:  You're saying
<em>"I knew that."</em>  It is the temptation to think you know and to speak and not to listen
to others.  LISTEN:  Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love and
peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.  Don't have anything to do
with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels. And the Lord's
servant must not quarrel; instead, he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.
Those who oppose him he must gently instruct.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Power enables us, love frees us, wisdom guides us, gifts of the Spirit in us bring courage.
<br> The good news is this: Timothy need never say <strong><em>"I didn't do it because I was
afraid."</em></strong>  <br>Neither do we.
