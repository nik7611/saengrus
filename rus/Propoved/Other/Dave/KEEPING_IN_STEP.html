<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Sunday night as I was turning over in my mind what
I had planned to say this morning, I sensed that it had become flat, with no sense of inner
life and urgency.  I sensed I was being drawn by God to speak on the Spirit and how to respond
to his presence among us.  This did not surprise me as some questions had been raised during
the Father's Heart Conference last weekend about a few things that were witnessed.  Keeping in
step with the Spirit is also a theme in the spiritual formation of a congregation and so it
also fits our present series <strong><em>How God grows People</em></strong>.  I will look to
the apostle Paul for my guidance.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Paul is undoubtedly a man of the Spirit - a charismatic who would also say that every believer
is a charismatic (charism means grace), that every believer is graced by the Spirit.  Paul is
not afraid of the Spirit so what he says is not out of fear but wisdom.  Paul also knows his
way around the world of the Spirit and is a capable and wise guide for us whenever we encounter
the Spirit's presence and work.  Paul provides guidance for these encounters in a way that bows
to the Spirit but also respects the personhood and integrity of every believer.  Because he is
a man of the Spirit, he is concerned that spiritual ministry be helpful to the spiritual
progress of others.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Before we get to Paul's counsel, let me give a brief history of the Spirit and the church in
the Bible.  The Spirit has had a checkered, inconsistent experience with the church.  Some
times were good, others weren't.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When the Spirit came, he came as the prophet Joel said he would - he came on all flesh, women
and men, old and young, servants and free people and now prophecies, visions and dreams were
not the ministry of the few but the many.  The Spirit had come on everyone and they were all
now living in the Spirit.  But to quote Paul Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step
with the Spirit..  We haven't always done that well.  The joy-filled days of Pentecost had
barely subsided when the Holy Spirit was lied to by a sneaky couple named Ananias and Sapphira
who wanted to look good by giving a sizable gift to the church, all they got from the sale of
some land so they said, when they kept back some of it.  The Spirit was not taken in by the
lie, for he cannot be fooled, and for their brazen testing of the Spirit they paid with their
lives.  Too bad.  They could have simply given part of what they got from the sale without
lying & it would have been fine.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
People full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom were trusted to care for the vulnerable in the
church.  The Spirit empowered and guided the early church in prayer and expanding witness.
Philip, one of the 12 apostles, entered Samaria and many believed the gospel.  One believer
named Simon, who had been a headliner in town for quite a while as a sorcerer and had amazed
the people with his magic, followed Philip around and saw the signs and miracles he did.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When Peter and John, and especially Peter who was so instrumental in the Spirit coming on the
Jewish believers at Pentecost, came to Samaria and laid their hands on the Samaritan believers,
they received the Holy Spirit.  When Simon saw that the Spirit could be given by the apostles
laying their hands on people, he wanted in on the attention.  He offered them money for this
power.  He was trying to use the power of God to gain a following.  Peter responded with
<em>"May your money perish with you!"</em>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Apostles Barnabas and Paul worked in the Spirit's strength.  Among the early prophets, one
called Agabus and the four daughters of Philip were empowered by the Spirit and served the
church well with their words.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Paul founded a church in the city of Corinth, a church that had received the gifts of the
Spirit in full.  But they had become riddled with arrogance and selfishness. They had fixated
on one expression of the life of the Spirit, speaking in tongues, when he had provided a wide
array of gifts.  Paul encourages them to broaden their appetite for other gifts, especially
prophecy.  Paul has to correct them against being discourteous or uncontrolled or disorderly
because gifts were all given for the common good.  The church had fallen into the sad state of
exercising the gifts of the Spirit without love, the primary fruit of the Spirit, and so became
of no benefit to anyone - it was just a noisy church.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
People were being filled with the Spirit to boldly share the gospel and to bring hope and
compassion and healing.  Paul founded a church in Thessalonica.  They too needed some help in
their life in the Holy Spirit:

contempt. Test everything. Hold on to the good. Avoid every kind of evil.
</td></tr>
<tr class="w1text">
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Spirit's presence was manifested in part through
prophetic words from people who had been given the gift of speaking a word from the Lord.  It
appears that people were not responsive to these prophecies.  They were treating them lightly
and in doing so, were unconsciously suppressing the Spirit as he moved within the church.
There is to be an openness to the Spirit by being receptive to his words given through gifted
people.  But Paul doesn't encourage a mindless approach.  Paul guides them to be discerning
instead of dismissive when it came to prophetic words.  Test everything. Hold on to the good.
Avoid every kind of evil.   Sift and separate the nourishing wheat from the useless chaff.
You'll find them both.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Exercising the prophetic gift was not to be a closed circle.  A prophet could not say <em>"The
Spirit gave me this gift and I speak what I have been given to speak and you have no part in
this."  </em>Each person's gift as well as its use belongs not to them, but to the community.
And so the community is expected to participate in the prophetic word in two ways:  receive it
fully and weigh it carefully.  Test it.  Does it reflect the work of the Spirit or not?
  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have experienced this testing in a fashion in my preaching ministry.  At the church I served
before, I met with two mature and wise people who would go over my recent messages and give
their judgement as to where it lacked the full light and truth of God or whether there was
something I was doing that was unhelpful or getting in the way.  Painful?  Yes!  Helpful?
Absolutely!
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Perhaps an idea that comes from this passage is that when a church has a speaker in for some
meetings, the invitation could include "After your ministry we will be glad to provide you with
feedback for the strengthening of your ministry."  If they are not agreeable to that I would
encourage you to not invite them.  That is not quenching the Spirit, but testing everything.
Paul's guidance is very even-handed for he is a conscientious charismatic.  There is always
something to heed, something to watch for regardless of where you find yourself on the
charismatic spectrum.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This brief history shows that the Spirit's history with the church is checkered.  So it is in
the present.
What about when strange things that happen and people attribute it to the Spirit?  When you
read the whole Bible it is difficult to escape the fact that the Spirit sometimes moved people
to do some strange things.  How do you test those?  Our level of comfort?  What makes sense to
our 21st century rationalistic Western minds?
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In 1 Sam. 19 the Spirit of God came upon King Saul, and he began to prophesy!  He tore off his
clothes and lay naked on the ground all day and all night, prophesying in the presence of
Samuel. Two prayers arise in me when I think of this <strong><em>"Please Lord, don't ever do
that here!  If you do, please don't use me!  There are plenty of other people you could
use!"</em></strong>
In Isaiah 20, God told Isaiah "Go, take off your clothes and sandals," and Isaiah did it, going
about naked and barefooted.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In Ezekiel 4, God told Ezekiel to build a model of an army attacking Jerusalem, then get an
iron skillet and place it upright between him and the model city.  <strong><em>"Lie on your
left side for 390 days.  Then, turn over and lie down on your right side for 40 days.  Look
straight at the siege of Jerusalem. Roll up your sleeve, shake your bare arm, and preach
against her…I will tie you up with ropes, tie you so you can't move or turn over until you have
finished the days of the siege." </em></strong>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then he arranged for food.  <strong><em>"Bake it out in the open where everyone can see you,
using dried human dung for fuel."  Now that got to Ezekiel.  Lord, I've never contaminated
myself with food like that."  "All right," God said. "I'll let you bake your bread over cow
dung instead of human dung."</em></strong>  That doesn't seem much better to me!  Enough said.
Not everything is like that and that is certainly not the usual but it's there.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Are these strange manifestations to be attributed to the Spirit?  Yes.  Are all strange things
to be attributed to the Spirit?  No.  Do we throw it all away?  No.  Richard Foster encourages
us when he says <em>"Rest easy with your fears that some aspect of what you are doing is in the
flesh.  I can guarantee you there will be flesh in it!  To be sure we never want to manipulate
others or be manipulated by others, but we should not be afraid to step out and exercise our
gifts."</em>  Let's allow that freedom to each other.  Also let's be teachable and open to
testing.  Let testing be done in a gracious manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How could we test a prophecy or some manifestation?  Some people have found the following to be
helpful:  Reflection in Scripture (what does the Bible reveal?) Tradition (what does 2000 years
of church history show?) Reason (what confirmation comes from careful thinking?) and Experience
(what effects are brought to life in our personal and communal journey in Christ?)
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Paul is also aware of the impact of the "strange" on people.  In 1 Cor. 14 he comments on how
an orderly manifestation of the Spirit will help any inquirers and unbelievers who see it, not
to mention brothers and sisters in Christ, as opposed to driving them away and giving them good
cause to mock the church.
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Finally, we are told to not grieve the Holy Spirit in our relationships with each other for it
is devilish that the one who is keeping us together in his unity would be used to drive us
apart.

<td>Ephesians 4:30-32 <br>
And do not bring sorrow to God's Holy Spirit by the way you live. Remember, he has identified
you as his own, guaranteeing that you will be saved on the day of redemption.  Get rid of all
bitterness, rage, anger, harsh words, and slander, as well as all types of evil behavior.
Instead, be kind to each other, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, just as God through
Christ has forgiven you.

<td>I close with this old Hasidic tale: A rabbi asked his students:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 "How can we determine the hour of dawn, when the night ends and the day begins? <br> One of
the rabbi's students suggested:

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When from a distance you can distinguish between a dog
and a sheep?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," was the answer of the rabbi.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it when one can distinguish between a fig tree and
a grapevine?" asked a second student.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"No," the rabbi said. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please tell us the answer then,"
said the students. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is, then," said the wise
teacher, "when you can look into the face of another human being and you have enough light in
you to recognize your brother or your sister.  Until then it is night, and the darkness is
still with us." <br> So, when we look at the people all across the charismatic spectrum and
recognize them and treat them as brother and sister, then the darkness is gone and the light
has come.
<br><br>
In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. <br>
 Amen.
