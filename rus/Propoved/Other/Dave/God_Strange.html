<td>In a few days cries of "Happy Holidays" will fill the air.  For those who want to be more
pointed and I am among them, we will say "Merry Christmas."  But if we want to go further in
the spirit of the actual nativity story as it is written in the Bible, I am suggesting that we
adopt a new greeting this year.  Let's wish each other "A Very Inconvenient Christmas and a
Truly Interrupted New Year!"  After all, that's how it all began.  We love convenience and we
don't like interruptions but this is precisely how Jesus, the Son of God, came to earth, with
great inconvenience and as a huge interruption.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
However we are preparing for Christmas this year, all of us are invited to hear how the Son of
God became human in one Mary of Nazareth, an unsuspecting young girl in her teens who probably
wanted her life to go as smoothly as you hope yours will go, but who got royally interrupted by
God and had to deal with it as best she knew how.  Luke's gospel tells the story of what has
come to be known as the Annunciation or the Announcement.  Read Luke 1:26-45

<td><font size="+1">The Birth of Jesus Foretold</font><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 26In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

27to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's
name was Mary.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
28The angel went to her and said, "Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with
you."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 29Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 30But the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God.
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 31You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus.
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 32He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the
throne of his father David,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
33and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end."

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 34"How will this be," Mary asked the angel, "since I am a virgin?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 35The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will
overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called[c] the Son of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
36Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to
be barren is in her sixth month.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
37For nothing is impossible with God."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 38"I am the Lord's servant," Mary answered. "May it be to me as you have said." Then the angel
left her.
 <br><br>
<font size="+1">Mary Visits Elizabeth</font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 39At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea,
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 40where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth.
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 41When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled
with the Holy Spirit.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
42In a loud voice she exclaimed: "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you
will bear!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
43But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
44As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
45Blessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished!"

<td>Mary was living a normal life for a young girl and she was pledged or betrothed to be
married as were girls her age.  She was set for life.  And then Gabriel the angel appeared. Do
you ever notice: in the Bible angels got into the very bad habit of never knocking?  Good
morning, favourite girl.  Who, me?  The Lord is with you.  He is?! Gabriel, not known for small
talk continues.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He doesn't ask for her cooperation.  There is no "Please", no <strong>"Would you ever consider
being the mother of the Son of the Most High?"</strong> This is not a proposal, a request.  God
doesn't observe any of the language of partnership and signs of collaboration and working
together that we expect from people.  This angel is pretty aggressive.  Some of us may feel
ambivalent about this: How could he just drop this into the life of a young girl?!  Would I
like my own daughter put in this predicament?  Can young Mary even be held responsible for her
part in this conversation?  It is hardly a level playing field, a young girl versus a seasoned
angel.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Did Gabriel assume it was good news any way you looked at it?  He may have had no idea of the
impact of his words.  He just says <strong>"You're going to have a baby.  That's the
plan."</strong>  What would an angel know about having a baby anyway?!  Can he appreciate what
this news will mean to Mary?!  She might have preferred an ordinary day, a peaceful period of
betrothal, followed by marriage to Joseph and an ordinary family and a nice life. That was
taken away by Gabriel.  Was Mary really blessed or just really interrupted?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Angels are fine as long as they are hanging glittering and silent in your Christmas tree or
window or perched woodenly on a knickknack shelf.  The real ones are a little more troublesome.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

How is she supposed to respond?  Maybe her eyes catch sight of a book on her night-table
Personal Boundaries: Regaining Control of your Life.  It was a good read, but she couldn't
remember anything in it about angels.  Maybe she wonders about negotiating for more time.  Uh,
Mr. Angel, I'd like to think about this.  In fact, I'd like to fast and pray about this.  I'd
like to get my youth group down at the synagogue to pray as well.  And I'd like to talk to my
parents about this.  You know that honour your father and mother thing in the law.  Better tell
them before than after don't you think?!  Dad.  Mom.  I'm pregnant.  This is the kind of thing
you'd like your daughter to talk with you about first right?  But as if to deny all these
reasonable requests, Gabriel has already spoken: <strong>"You will be with child and you will
give birth to a son and you are to give him the name Jesus. That's the plan."</strong> This is
one bossy angel.  Some people say God is a gentleman.  If his angels are any indication, I
wonder about that.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We don't like teachers who pile on homework like theirs is the only class we take and we have
no life other than to do their assignments. We bristle against demanding family members who act
like their lives are more important than ours, their "Yes" more reasonable than our "No." We
don't like people who think they can waltz into our life any time they want and expect us to
drop everything and do what they want.  We can find ourselves resisting them even if their name
is Gabriel.  Even if it is God.  We call these people forward, presumptuous, brazen, bold,
nervy, difficult.  We may be shocked to realize that God is somewhat like these people that we
resist.   Paul Scott Wilson says it well, "We encounter God as total acceptance and total
demand."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Living with God is all about entertaining these troublesome and unpredictable angels, if I can
continue the imagery, who show up at inconvenient times and places. Sometimes these
annunciations don't seem like good news.  They may look like blows or set-backs, interruptions
and intrusions into our well-planned lives.  Occasionally the news is good, but annunciations
can take the form of downright bad news: illness, rejection, loss, failure and bereavement.
And we might get angry.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jeanette Bakke writes <em>"Most of our lives are spent somewhere between flight from God and
complete agreement with God, between being keenly aware of or oblivious to God.  Our responses
are mixed.  We sense the Spirit asking us to release our whole selves into God's care and our
answer is a conflicted 'Yes & No'.  Even though we would like to be God's without reservation,
we also like having a sense of control over our destiny.  Releasing our life to another, even
to God, is not easy."</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It wasn't easy for Mary.  She was confused.  <strong>"How, I am a virgin?"</strong> Other
miraculous births had always involved a man and a woman, perhaps old, perhaps incapable of
having children, but never just one woman on her own!  Somehow Gabriel must have communicated
to her that this was soon, not five years down the road.  Was Joseph going to show up tonight
and say <strong>"Let's elope.  We're going to Vegas."</strong>  Would she be forced against her
will by someone?  Would she break her pledge to Joseph?
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Maybe Gabriel sits down here.  For all his gruffness, he's not all business.  He wears God's
heart on his angelic sleeve.  While God is intrusive, he does not run roughshod over Mary.
While he is Lord he is not belligerent.  While sovereign, he is not brutal.  He is love itself.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Gabriel explains this conception.  He doesn't get overly technical, which may be a
disappointment for our DNA-curious culture.  This will not turn into the first episode of CSI
Nazareth, Conception Scene Investigation.  It is about divine presence.  He says "The Spirit of
God will work a miracle in your womb.  No human father will be involved, only the overshadowing
power and presence of God, the Spirit of life, so your son will be God's Son, the Lord. God can
do the impossible"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then he adds Oh Mary, you know your old, childless aunt Elizabeth?  By God's grace, she's
expecting.  She's six months along and understands something about miraculous births, not
exactly like yours, but close enough.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is Mary's moment.  The ball is in her court.  What will she do?  She does a remarkable
thing.  I can see her in my mind's eye, drawing herself up to her full height, squaring her
shoulders in a way that would make any dad or mom proud, and looking straight into the eyes of
the angel.  Mr. Gabriel, you are looking at the Lord's servant.  This is willing submission, a
strong surrender with no hint of a begrudging spirit.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then she expresses her heart in the form of a prayer - may it happen to me just as you say.
God's call becomes Mary's prayer.  The idea of being the Lord's servant wasn't something that
came into her head during this conversation. Doesn't pull it out for special religious
occasions when the music moves her.  This is not sentimental language. She speaks it when her
whole life is in the balance.  It was how she saw herself.  To use Paul's words in Romans 12,
Mary was presenting her body as a living sacrifice to God.  Perhaps to Mary, God was not the
least bit intrusive?  She was his servant, always at his beck & call.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Maybe we're jealous of Mary?  "I'd say Yes to God if I knew everything like Mary did. Gabriel
laid it all out, plain and clear.  Really?  Did Mary know all that was involved?  Was it a
fully informed <strong>"Yes"</strong>?  No <strong>"Yes"</strong> is ever fully informed.  We
always have unanswered questions.  There is always mystery in saying <strong>"Yes"</strong> to
God whether you're saying <strong>"Yes"</strong> for the very first time in your life or saying
<strong>"Yes"</strong> for the hundredth time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So where can we find the ability to say a willing yes?  God gave Mary a willing & courageous
heart.  There is a verse in Phil 2 that shows what is happening in Mary's heart.  It is what
happens in our hearts too.  Phil 2:13 - God is working in you, giving you the desire and the
power to do what pleases him.
We can trust his work in us and we will be able to do what is inconvenient, what is
unreasonable. Things we never thought we would be able to do.  We can forgive.  Give.  Conquer.
Serve.  Love.  Go there.  Do this.  Be reconciled to each other.  We can believe. We can carry
our cross.  We can go the distance.  We can do whatever he calls us to do.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Can we take a "pass"?  Will God take a <strong>"No"</strong>?  Mary could have said
<strong>"No."</strong>  Saying <strong>"No"</strong> is a means of birth control.
<strong>"God, I'd like to abstain please."</strong>  Saying <strong>"No"</strong> to God is
always an option.  How will God respond?  Who knows?  How will your own soul live after saying
<strong>"No"</strong>?  Who knows?  All we do know for certain is that <strong>"No"</strong> is
not the way of love and trust.  Neither is it the way of courage and faith.  And it was not
Mary's way.  Some call it surrendering to love.  You may simply call it saying a strong
<strong>"Yes"</strong> to God.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mary is a model to all of us about how to live with and for God.  She is our older spiritual
sister.  Later in Luke 1 she composed a praise song about how God looked into a world full of
big powerful people and chose an easily overlooked girl for special glory.  Mary feels more
blessed than Queen Elizabeth, Martina Navratilova, Belinda Stronach and Oprah Winfrey all
rolled into one!
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pregnancy and childbirth involve discomfort and pain.  People who have decided to live life
with God instead of against him do not avoid obedience because it is hard and because it might
involve pain.  Eugene Peterson prayed <em>"God, I don't want to go through my life always
looking for easy, painless paths.  I want to find the true way, and the right path."</em>
Gabriel has appeared.  God is at work interrupting you, calling you to do the inconvenient and
painful.  But the inconvenience and pain of obedience leads to joy.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I remember when we were expecting our first child Heather.  We were in the labour room.  Most
of the pain and inconvenience was Margie's.  Okay, all of the pain!  I was keeping track of the
length of contractions and the space between them on a piece of paper on the other side of the
room.  I would dutifully leave Marg during her contractions to record the info, when she
finally growled <em>"Bring the paper over here!"</em>  I think I remember there were a few
other words she said but I can't quite recall them right now.  And then finally after all the
pain the joy of our first child!
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mary knew this joy even though everything about being pregnant and giving birth was not
enjoyable.  Brian Stiller, the president of Tyndale Seminary wrote <em>"I've been
asked-especially since I've moved into academic leadership-'Brian, are you enjoying your work?'
My only honest response is, 'The question I wish you'd ask is, "Are you doing what you should
be doing?" To that I answer, 'Yes.'"</em>  Obedience becomes the operative word and obedience
brings its own particular deep joy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So in the spirit of wanting you all to have a life of joy with God, I wish you all <em>"A Very
Inconvenient Christmas and a Truly Interrupted New Year!"</em>
