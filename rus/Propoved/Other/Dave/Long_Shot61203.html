<td>Now speaking of chances, I don't buy lottery tickets.  It has something to do with my
upbringing, my sense of why I would if I did, and about the smart use of my money.  This week
Margie and I went to our condo's annual general meeting.  They planned to give everyone who
attended a free lottery ticket.  Attendance was low and so everyone there got three tickets and
the rest were given to those whose names were drawn from the list of attendees.  We ended up
coming home with four free lottery tickets.  With four tickets, I thought I couldn't help but
win something.  I mean, how many different number combinations could there be?!  I knew that
the late news gave the numbers and so I stayed up to listen.  When they read the number out, I
was ready with pen in hand.  I wrote them out and then looked at them.  They were nothing like
my numbers!   I quickly realized how many different number combinations there could be.
Winning was now an absolutely unreasonable expectation.  When I dragged myself up to bed at
11:45, I was once again renewed in my stance that lotteries are a waste of time, money, effort,
hope and life.  Besides that, they are a long shot.

<td>The Bible is a book of long shots.  READ Luke
1:5-25<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 5 In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the
priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
6 Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commands and
decrees blamelessly.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
7 But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive, and they were both well
advanced in years.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    8 Once when Zechariah's division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	9 he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the
temple of the Lord and burn incense.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
10 And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying
outside.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    11 Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of
incense.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	12 When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	13 But the angel said to him: "Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard.
Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
14 He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
15 for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented
drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
16 Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord their God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
17 And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of
the parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous—to make ready
a people prepared for the Lord."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    18 Zechariah asked the angel, "How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is
well along in years."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    19 The angel said to him, "I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been
sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

20 And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did
not believe my words, which will come true at their appointed time."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    21 Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in
the temple.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
22 When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the
temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    23 When his time of service was completed, he returned home.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	24 After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in
seclusion.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	25 "The Lord has done this for me," she said. "In these days he has shown his favor and
taken away my disgrace among the people."

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the days of King Herod…  Now King Herod, or
Herod the Great as he was known, was an over-achiever.  You don't get to be called great for
nothing.  It was a family trait of the Herods that they always got in good with whoever was in
charge.  He didn't leave things to chance.  He manipulated and maneuvered to increase his odds.
 In the days of Mark Anthony and Cleopatra, Herod was good friends with Mark Anthony.  When
Octavian (later known as Caesar Augustus) rose to power, Herod quickly swore allegiance to him
and they became good friends.  Augustus considered Herod to be a man who would serve him well
and he was appointed "king of the Jews", who were a conquered people.  Old Zechariah was one of
these conquered Jews along with his wife Elizabeth, an unremarkable couple.  Zechariah was one
of many hundreds of rank and file priests that belonged to the division of Abijah, one of the
24 large groups of priests descended from the great first high priest Aaron.  Descending from
Aaron was their only claim to fame, but he was ancient history now.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Zechariah was leaving his home in the hill country of Judea to travel to the Holy City.  Every
division of priests performed their duty at the Jerusalem temple for two weeks in the year.  It
was Abijah's turn.  They were division #8 on the service roster.  Even at his age, old
Zechariah could still make the trip so he kissed his wife Elizabeth goodbye and set off.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Old Elizabeth seemed to grow in her sadness each time he left.  If only every time he went to
Jerusalem he could leave her in the company of a son or daughter, or maybe two or three, and
grandchildren (!) but they had no children.  Elizabeth had been unable to conceive.  It was
painful to be childless and without any fertility clinics around Elizabeth had carried the
stigma as best she could over the years.  In their Hebrew Scriptures, God had rebuked women by
infertility.  But if you asked God, he would say they were both good and faithful people,
careful in obedience and observing every commandment and law.  So it was a mystery why she
suffered this way.  "They're good people." said her neighbours, "You never know why these
things happen…"
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When Zechariah reached Jerusalem he gathered with the other priests for the draw, a priestly
lottery.  Every morning and evening for their two week duty at the temple, a priest would go
alone into the Holy Place of the temple and put fresh incense on the altar of incense while the
people waited outside praying.  Then he would come out and gave them the blessing.  A priest
had to win the lottery, have his name drawn, to be able to do this.  It was a high privilege.
A priest could only get to do this task once in his life and many never got the opportunity.
Old Zechariah was running low on chances.  And we all know the chances of winning a lottery are
ridiculously miniscule, a long shot.  Everything was against them.  Considering their ages, the
infertility and childlessness, the odds of winning the priestly lottery, chances of anything
significant happening in their lives at all, life for Zecharaiah and Elizabeth consisted of one
long shot after another.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In our day we have some success in dealing with these issues.  We are told we can halt aging
with the right regimen of creams, therapies and treatments.  The people who suffer from
infertility might be helped through reproductive technologies.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So all is taken care of right?  There are no modern-day Zechariahs and Elizabeths right?  No,
people still age.  Couples are still childless.  More than that, we still know the pain of
regret, of dreams that never materialize, hopes that have died on the vine, when too much time
has passed & to continue to hope goes against all reasonable expectation.  We know what it is
to be too long in the same dead-end job or suffering too long with the same physical condition.
 Our children have lived too long without God.  My family has functioned too long like this and
change is impossible.  We know what it is like to be trapped by the same addictions, habits,
behaviours, thoughts and voices for so long that we've given up hope of ever being delivered
from them.  It can seem like our lives have been barren and infertile for so long we are
convinced that nothing new will ever be born in us.  And when we pray about these things, it
seems like God is sitting on his hands.  Our prayers and our faith become old and crippled.
Dates and deadlines have come and gone and God has been silent.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I remember the first time I was too old for something, that too much time had passed.  Back a
number of years ago, I was in a class at Tyndale Seminary and heard about a leadership training
opportunity with a man called Leighton Ford.  He was putting together a group of young men to
train them to be leaders in the world for the sake of Jesus.  My interest grew over the course
of the presentation and then at the end the teacher said that if anyone between the ages of
25-35 was interested to see him after class and he'd give us the information.  I was about 37
at the time.  I was too old!  Leighton Ford wasn't interested in me.  Not enough bang for the
buck.  Not fertile enough!  I am 49 now, well into the last half of my life based on North
American life expectancies.  Will I, will you get to do what we hope to do?  It grows less
certain each year.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In this scientific age we live in, people study long shots.  Probability theory is the
mathematical study of random events.  Probability theorists say that probability always lies
between 0 and 1.  If probability is equal to 1 then that event is certain to happen and if the
probability is 0 then that event will never occur.  We live between 0 and 1.  It is an anxious
place.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
People can try to find refuge in fatalism, giving themselves over to "whatever will be, will
be", whatever is meant to happen.  But that is to put the power in the process itself, not the
providential care of God who is Lord even over what is meant to happen.  What is meant to be is
like a snowball that is starting down a hill and is gaining speed and size every moment so that
as it nears you there is no escape.  It will happen.  That is not the gospel.  That is not what
God calls us to believe.  He is Lord over the long shot, Lord over probability theory, Lord
over what is meant to be, Lord over what has been for so long that it cannot change.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

And he showed it in the lives of Zechariah and Elizabeth.  He won the priestly lottery!  Now
maybe some people said that this was his "lucky" day, or that it was meant to be!  Nervous and
excited, he got the incense and entered the temple and then the Holy Place, while the huge
crowd waited outside.  The altar of incense was at the far end of the Holy Place just before
the curtain that separated it from the Holiest Place where the ark of the covenant was in the
presence of God.  While Zechariah was quietly doing his service, an angel suddenly appeared
standing just to the right of the altar.  Zechariah was terrified.  But the angel said "Don't
be afraid Zechariah.  God has heard your prayer."
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Prayer, what prayer?! He was drawing a blank!  Your wife Elizabeth will give you a son!  That
prayer?!  Why, he had ceased to pray that prayer years ago.  When it became clear that God was
not going to answer.   If we want a God who always moves quickly we will need to look
elsewhere.  A stream of amazing words came tumbling out of the angel's mouth.  Zechariah tried
to take it all in …his name will be John…you will be very, very happy and so will many other
people…he will be great in the eyes of the Lord…he is to stay clear of wine and intoxicating
drinks (which was a special form of dedication to God)…he will be filled with the Holy Spirit
even in his mother's womb…and he will turn many people back to God… he's going to come on
strong like the ancient prophet Elijah who took on everyone and won…he will prepare people for
the coming of the Lord…he will lead this  generation in faithful living and wise obedience."
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Zechariah doesn't know what to say!  It's too much.  He swallows and finally squeaks "You sure
about this?  I'm not.  My wife and I are too old for this to happen."  The angel shot back "I
am Gabriel and I stand in the presence of God.  He told me to come and give you the good news!
Since you didn't believe me, you will not be able to speak until John is born.  What I have
said will happen, will happen."
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
By now people where wondering what was happening.  The crowd outside the temple was getting
restless.  When he finally came out he had to make signs to communicate with them.  Three words
first word.  Charades was born.  He finished the rest of his priestly assignment and then went
home to Elizabeth who shortly thereafter became pregnant and spent time by herself for a 5
month spiritual retreat.  "God is so good!  So this is how he has decided to take away the
grief I get."  Probably not a bad trade-off for Zechariah: a mouth that wouldn't work for nine
months for a womb that would.  I could live with that.  Being speechless can be a gift.

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the chances that this old, childless couple
will end up making history?  Zero.  But they had a son and their son ended up introducing
people to the Saviour of the World!
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Who knows what will become of us?!  Our lives are still being written by God.  God is the Lord
over probability, Lord over the long shot.  Right from "In the beginning God created the
heavens and the earth" through to "Come Lord Jesus" our triune God is doing the improbable, the
impossible, the implausible, the incredible, the unbelievable, the inconceivable, more than we
can ask or imagine.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What are the chances that God would take people like us and involve us in something he is doing
that is meaningful and significant?  Is it a long shot?  Even if it is, God has been beating
the odds throughout human history-and he will always do something with those who are expectant
and full of trust.  That is a sure thing!
