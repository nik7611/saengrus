<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"What are you doing?!"</em>  This is the question
that parents call out when their children in the next room are unusually quiet.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<em>"What do you do?"</em>  This is the question that comes up in conversation among adults.
It wants to find out what is important to us: what people do.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<em>"Are you doing what you're supposed to be doing?"</em>  This is the question that gets to
the heart of your life.

<td>Jeremiah 1:<br>
1 The words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, one of the priests at Anathoth in the territory of
Benjamin.
<br>2 The word of the LORD came to him in the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah son of
Amon king of Judah,
<br>3 and through the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, down to the fifth month
of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, when the people of Jerusalem went
into exile.
The Call of Jeremiah
<br> 4 The word of the LORD came to me, saying,

<br> 5 "Before I formed you in the womb I knew [a] you,
       before you were born I set you apart;
       I appointed you as a prophet to the nations."

<br> 6 "Ah, Sovereign LORD," I said, "I do not know how to speak; I am only a child."

 <br>7 But the LORD said to me, "Do not say, 'I am only a child.' You must go to everyone I
send you to and say whatever I command you. <br>
8 Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you and will rescue you," declares the LORD.

 <br>9 Then the LORD reached out his hand and touched my mouth and said to me, "Now, I have put
my words in your mouth. <br>

10 See, today I appoint you over nations and kingdoms to uproot and tear down, to destroy and
overthrow, to build and to plant."

<td>Jeremiah was a young man in the morally and socially corrupt kingdom of Judah in 627 B.C.
One of his contemporaries was young King Josiah (21 at the time) who was trying to turn the
people back to God.  But it's like Jeremiah is in the stands watching Josiah fighting it out
down on the playing field.  We call out <em>"What are you doing Jeremiah?"</em>  Oh, I'm
watching King Josiah clean up the kingdom of Judah.  I'm a big fan of his.  See I have my
Josiah T-shirt (Number 8 - that's how old he was when he became king you know) & I know all his
stats.  He's doing a great job isn't he, burning shrines & tearing down altars & purging the
temple of all the idols & dealing with all the unfaithful priests.  Go Josiah Go!"
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then somewhere in between Jeremiah's first hot dog and his Big Slurpee, God speaks to him.
<strong><em>"I don't just want you to be a fan, I want you on the team.  I want you out on the
field.  I've had my eye on you for a quite a while now and I want you to be my prophet in all
of this mess."     </em></strong><br>
Now prophets have always been a mixed bag.  The church and even the general culture recognize
prophets that comes from time to time, or at least people who somehow have a prophetic
presence, those people who have a message that transcends all the noise, a message that reaches
into the collective soul of a nation or a church and calls it to be something beyond what it is
now.  That's the good side.  Then there have always been the charlatans, the fakes, those who
present themselves as prophets so they can hear the sound of their own voice or help themselves
to the money of the gullible or spout the latest and most popular theories on all the hot
button topics.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

God is at work within this mixed bag & he raises people up to be his prophets, to speak his
words, to announce his intentions, in a culture or situation that needs to hear them.  We are
always made aware in the Bible that there are true prophets & fake ones and we are told to be
careful.  What fruit do their lives produce?  What character do they exhibit?  Jeremiah is a
tested and approved prophet in all ways.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
God said to him, "I've had my eye on you for a while now and I want you to be my prophet in all
of this mess.  God has forethought and intention.  Not - Oh great, Hilkiah and his wife just
had a baby - now what am I going to do with it?  I have a world full of people and they have
just made my responsibility one person heavier.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
God is saying to Jeremiah <strong><em>"I knew all about you and chose you before I formed you
in your mother's womb, before you ever came to be.  Before you were born I purposed for you to
be my prophet to my people and to the nations."</em></strong>      What an enormous sense of
gift comes with these words!  That God would have such intimate knowledge of us.  He knows us
by name.

<td><pre>Psalm 139
1 O LORD, you have searched me
       and you know me.

 2 You know when I sit and when I rise;
       you perceive my thoughts from afar.

 3 You discern my going out and my lying down;
       you are familiar with all my ways.

 4 Before a word is on my tongue
       you know it completely, O LORD.

 5 You hem me in—behind and before;
       you have laid your hand upon me.

 6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me,
       too lofty for me to attain.

 7 Where can I go from your Spirit?
       Where can I flee from your presence?

 8 If I go up to the heavens, you are there;
       if I make my bed in the depths, [a] you are there.

 9 If I rise on the wings of the dawn,
       if I settle on the far side of the sea,

 10 even there your hand will guide me,
       your right hand will hold me fast.

 11 If I say, "Surely the darkness will hide me
       and the light become night around me,"

 12 even the darkness will not be dark to you;
       the night will shine like the day,
       for darkness is as light to you.

 13 For you created my inmost being;
       you knit me together in my mother's womb.

 14 I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made;
       your works are wonderful,
       I know that full well.

 15 My frame was not hidden from you
       when I was made in the secret place.
       When I was woven together in the depths of the earth,

 16 your eyes saw my unformed body.
       All the days ordained for me
       were written in your book
       before one of them came to be.

 17 How precious to [b] me are your thoughts, O God!
       How vast is the sum of them!

 18 Were I to count them,
       they would outnumber the grains of sand.
       When I awake,
       I am still with you.

 19 If only you would slay the wicked, O God!
       Away from me, you bloodthirsty men!

 20 They speak of you with evil intent;
       your adversaries misuse your name.

 21 Do I not hate those who hate you, O LORD,
       and abhor those who rise up against you?

 22 I have nothing but hatred for them;
       I count them my enemies.

 23 Search me, O God, and know my heart;
       test me and know my anxious thoughts.

 24 See if there is any offensive way in me,
       and lead me in the way everlasting.</pre>

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God made all the delicate, inner parts of your body and
knit you together in your mother's womb.  He made you so wonderfully complex!  His workmanship
is marvelous.  He watched you as you were being formed in utter seclusion, as you were woven
together in the dark of the womb.  He saw you before you were born with an insight far greater
than any ultrasound could reveal.  Every day of your life was recorded in his book.  Every
moment was laid out before a single day had passed.  Make sure we do not understand this as
teaching that everything in your life is planned and you have to live out your fate, but that
God is thoroughly acquainted with his loving intentions for you and how he longs to see them
unfold.  As he was with Jeremiah.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But Jeremiah was resistant.  We have these movements within.  You know what I'm talking about,
the rationalization, refusal, hiding from God, dismissing the thought, filling the space with
noise and activity, somehow excusing ourselves and trying to get around what God is saying to
us.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Refusal never sounds so right as when it is reverent.  Listen to Jeremiah: O Sovereign LORD,
there's no way.  We can do this:  "Highest and true God, creator of all the universe & saviour
of my soul through Jesus Christ your son, no."
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I'm too young.  Only a youth unqualified by training and experience.  Sprinkle a little
self-critical remark on top like (Your work is too holy or important for me to be involved) and
it can feel like a trump card.  Be apologetic Ah, I sorry about this Lord, but…I really wish I
could, but…  "Can't" is often a way of saying "won't".
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
God is pretty abrupt here - Stop that kind of talk.  (God knows that if we say something often
enough we may begin to believe it!)  You're going to do this for me.  God addresses Jeremiah's
fear of people.  If God were going to send us out under our own steam then yes it is an issue!
BUT…I will be with you.  I will protect you.  I, the LORD, have spoken.  As if to say this
conversation is over, but then he goes on.  Look what he does.  It is not what he says but what
he does next.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Reached out to Jeremiah and touched his mouth.  Now you have my words in your mouth.  Now
sometimes we don't like it when people put words in our mouth.  "Let me speak for myself!"  On
the other hand, we don't like trusting people to speak for us.  We are picky about who we let
speak for us.  God isn't so choosy.  Today, I appoint you to stand up against nations and
kingdoms with a word that will be both destructive and constructive.  Serious warnings.  We
read in 2 Chr. 36:15 that God repeatedly sent his prophets to warn them, for he had compassion
on his people.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This reads like a brief conversation.  God may bring us through an extended process - my
processes tend to take months.  This one seems to take but a moment, one conversation and the
issue is over.  Not quite.  There are some remaining issues that surface later and need to be
worked through with God.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jeremiah struggled with his calling.  Sometimes it was hard for him.  Jer. 20:7 O LORD, you
misled me, and I allowed myself to be misled.  You are stronger than I am, and you overpowered
me.  Now I am mocked every day; everyone laughs at me.  When I speak, the words burst out.
"Violence and destruction!" I shout.  So these messages from the LORD have made me a household
joke.  But if I say I'll never mention the LORD or speak in his name, his word burns in my
heart like a fire.  It's like a fire in my bones!  I am worn out trying to hold it in!  I can't
do it!  Just because God said that he would be with him and protect him, didn't mean the
Jeremiah had an easy time of it.  It did mean and in all of his troubles, God was with him and
did protect him even thought he did suffer, his life was kept and God was faithful and
trustworthy and dependable.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So God had intentions for Jeremiah from before his conception.  What are God's intentions for
you?  What are you doing?  What are you supposed to be doing?  Are you doing what you're
supposed to be doing?  This is a question that is clarified over time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Douglas Shurrman - A modern assumption is that to have a calling is to experience
self-fulfillment in that calling.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Self-fulfillment has become a way of trying to know God's will for our lives.  We assume that
God's will must always further our sense of self-fulfilment.  If I feel fulfilled, I must be in
God's will.  If I don't I must have missed it.  It's not that our Father isn't interested in
our sense of fulfillment, or that being fulfilled or wanting to be fulfilled is not
appropriate.  But it is not central
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Brian Stiller:  I've been asked -especially since I've moved into academic leadership-"Brian,
are you enjoying your work?"  My only honest response is "The question I wish you'd ask is 'Are
you doing what you should be doing?'  To that I answer 'Yes.'"
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He goes on to say "Self-fulfillment has little to do with the big question "Am I in the place
ordered by the Lord?"  [Obedience is the word and, in the grace of God, it brings it's own
reward.]
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are moments when we feel rewarded, but that is not the gauge we should use.  Good times
come momentarily and are gone.  Some encounters leave me with self-doubt.  Self fulfillment may
be a by-product of God's leading.  But to make it the test of being in God's will is to distort
what obedience is.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Isaiah 6 - sending you to preach but you won't make a difference.  Not too rewarding.  Not too
fulfilling.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Closes with this prayer <br><strong>"Dear Father, I'd trade feelings of self-fulfillment any
day for knowing that in some modest way, my life is geared to fulfill your calling." <br>
Amen.</strong>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We can take on more responsibility in this than we need to.  God is responsible to call you.
We are not a self-called people.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We are responsible to listen.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We are responsible to do.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
May God equip you with everything good for doing his will, and may he work in us what is
pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. <br> Amen.
