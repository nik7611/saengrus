	<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><font color="#FF0000"><em>Just be yourself.</em></font></strong> This phrase is often used by parents as a philosophy of growth, teaching children to strive to grow up to be an individual. Unfortunately, this phrase is overused and has lost all meaning because children today are expected to grow up according to a society-created template. The notion of childhood is slowly disappearing as society is enforcing more and more regulations on how children are supposed to be raised. These restrictions are ideological, therefore, they are understood and enforced by millions of parents and guardians. From early childhood, mothers encourage their daughters not to play in mud because “nice girls don’t play with mud and get dirty”. Likewise, fathers do not tolerate their sons playing with dolls for the fear of helping to encourage homosexuality. During bedtime little boys and girls are read stories which promote such stereotypical gender roles with the purpose of establishing the ideological division of the sexes.

<font color="#FF0000"><strong><em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</em></strong></font> by Brothers Grimm is an excellent example of gender bias promotion. However, <br><font color="#FF0000"><strong><em>X: A Fabulous Child’s Story</em></strong></font> by Lois Gould does not talk about the status quo. This story describes a child growing up without those gender restrictions that are placed on children today. And yet, when a child matures, the fairytale “cute little girl/boy” label suddenly disappears and the “rebellious child” stereotype emerges.<br> <font color="#FF0000"><strong><em>Bowling for Columbine</em></strong></font> by Michael Moore shows exactly to what extent adults tend to see children as little monsters out of control. So, a paradox remains: how effective are the parents in promoting individuality if the children are placed into strict categories of “proper” gender behaviour and young adults are assumed to be “rebels without a cause”?
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fairy tales are always automatically associated with childhood, however, adults created the original fairy tales for other adults and not children. The stories used to be blatantly violent and did not
target children as recipients of the lessons taught. The morals within the stories were intended for adult audiences. Certain modifications made by various people throughout history have allowed for the stories to become appropriate to be read to children worldwide. However, has anyone really stopped to think about why fairytales were not intended as bedtime stories in the first place? Children are very quick to learn and conform when given the chance. Therefore, when all the stories that they are presented with represent a dominant ideology and the promotion of certain values, the child will most likely adopt these morals.<br> <font color="#FF0000"><strong><em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</em></strong></font> by Brothers Grimm is a very good example of that. Even though Disney has modified the original story throughout the years to apply to children, the messages in it still holds true. 
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The fairy tales that we know today were written for and by a patriarchal society. Very little credit was given to women as they were considered to be inferior to men. They were viewed as merely objects that needed to be on this Earth in order to reproduce. Consequently, traditional female roles in fairytales are an evil stepmother, a witch, or a damsel in distress. The latter role is usually assigned to the heroine of the story who usually tends to either be a princess or a girl who becomes a princess later on in the story. Usually little girls dream of being that princess because the princess image is beautiful and her life is simply a ‘happily ever after’ existence. There is also that hope that is created for the perfect prince to come along and swoop her off her feet and save the day. The lady in waiting then searches endlessly for that perfect man but, unfortunately, much of this pursuit is in vain. This helpless and lost image of a woman is imprinted into the minds of young girls and they can begin to believe that it is “okay” for a woman to become the domestic servant and to rely on her husband for all eternity. Another traditional quality attached to women in fairytales is lack of intelligence. Snow White was tricked into believing her stepmother three times and she still didn’t begin to suspect anything. All such classifications fail to provide an image for young girls to aspire to and fail to depict women accurately. A great example is the stepmother who is classified under the “evil women/witches” category. In the story she is also considered to be beautiful, but she’s very vain and conceited. Ironically, another fabulous image for the young girls to look up to! 

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Men, on the other hand, are depicted as gods. They are shown as the hard working providers that take care of the wife. Snow White is surrounded by men in the story. They are described as smarter than her in every way. It is the dwarves, not Snow White, that realize what the stepmother is up to. They are also able to bring Snow White back to life after she is almost killed by her stepmother several times. Then, there’s the knight in shining armour. He doesn’t even have to do anything and he is loved from the second he enters the story. He is shown as dignified, smart, handsome, and everything anyone could ever dream of. Therefore, boys are raised believing that they can become that powerful, confident and handsome character as they aspire to reach that goal of perfection. Also, the fact that men in fairy tales are depicted as above women hinders boys’ development significantly. Boys end up being raised believing the falsified woman’s role as the sexual object and domestic servant that bears children for her male counterpart who protects and provides for the family.  


<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This kind of segregation among children can result in restrictions placed upon both girls and boys. Girls are constantly being fed the message that all they need in life is to be pretty and then prosperity will follow. The “proper woman” is shown as a passive woman that does nothing but work in the kitchen and wait for her knight in shining armour to come rescue her. Men too, are force fed false stereotypes of being the dominant sex. By having children watch and read these stories parents are unconsciously teaching them of gender roles in today’s society. It is assumed that without such education children become lost and lack the appropriate gender identity to lead their lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font color="#FF0000"><strong><em>X: A Fabulous Child’s Story</em></strong></font> challenges this last assumption. The experiment conducted on this child has proven just how much value people place on gender roles. Baby X is brought up not knowing its sex and, therefore, X is not fed the stereotypes that are circulating in the world. To their astonishment, X’s parents find that X is not confused like everyone else would expect. Without the limitations of what is or
isn’t appropriate for X to participate in, it manages to surpass other students in the class and overall achieve greater happiness out of life. From this part of the story alone, it is evident that other girls and boys are growing up with limited potential. For example, school sports teams have always been separated into boys and girls. Even though there may be the possibility of a girl playing a ‘boy sport’ it is highly frowned upon by peers. The image of the dainty female that girls strive for has become a mandatory goal to follow. Any girl that decides to “be herself” and try to do something different, such as participating in a traditionally boys activity, she is labelled as an “outcast” and a “tomboy” with questionable sexual orientation. Same is true for boys as also shown in the story. If a boy is interested in playing ‘girl sports’ his sexuality automatically is questioned. The dominant fantasy in society classifies girls who don’t like pink ribbons in their hair and boys who refuse to play in the mud with their buddies as abnormal. This assumption, of course, is a shame as society should embrace everybody’s differences as a strength and not a weakness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This story does not only show the impact on the child who isn’t brainwashed but, it also deals with the society and the extent to which it upset everybody that X is not behaving according to societal rules. This standard is created in order to allow others to judge what is considered “normal” and what isn’t. When an individual tries to act different from what the rules suggest, that person is decided to be a problem to others in society. X acted differently from others and the parents of other children became upset at the strange behaviour displayed. Automatic reaction is to demand the removal of X from the company of other children lest its odd behaviour rub off on the others. The dominant fantasy of childhood is disrupted with this trouble-making X. What the parents didn’t realize is that X’s parents raised it without any restrictions which meant that X is free to live however it wants. X shows its peers what it means to actually be yourself and not to simply follow the standard that was established many, many years ago. X also proves that it is possible to go above those gender limitations placed on children right
from birth and to succeed. X actually shows that not giving in to those limitations allows more chance for success as demonstrated by this story. 

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Unfortunately, gender limitations are not the only restrictions being placed on children in today’s society. Media is a big influence on young minds. The media has created its own standard for children. Through various programming on television the image of the typical child was created. The news emphasize the stories that are considered interesting. Teenagers out of control seem to be a point of interest for the public. Because of the high rating that those stories got, the media decided to allow for more coverage. This really exaggerated the situation. Realistically, there are many more teenagers living their lives without hurting others or destroying property than outlaws that need to be controlled. Due to the focus of the media people began to get scared of their own children. Now, all people were seeing were teens robbing other people, killing other people, and doing other unspeakable deeds. This created a panic among the adults. Children were no longer to be trusted. Schools began to take extra precautions and the “hoodlum” character was created. Most pre-teenagers to teenagers became regarded as dangerous and uncontrollable.<br> <font color="#FF0000"><strong><em>Bowling for Columbine</em></strong></font> captures the fear that was created among the adult population. 
	

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This movie shows childhood at its worst. The shooting at Columbine High School is the main focus of the documentary. Based on the interviews that were conducted, people believe that there are several reasons that can cause violent behaviour in adolescents. Some believe that it is inbred. Others believe that it is environment induced. Most claim music to be a large influence on a child’s behaviour. Parents think that violent and aggressive music will result in violent and aggressive behaviour such as displayed in the movie. Society has even categorized certain music as “problematic” so if someone listens to that music, that person is automatically labelled as a possible threat. Everyone seems to be trying to find a scapegoat to blame for the problem that was created. Is it possible that this has become a self fulfilling prophecy? Are teenagers rebelling because they think they are supposed to? Well, deriving from the previous conclusion of boys brought up to be an aggressive and dominant figure, violence, perhaps
with a weapon, seems to be the only logical thing to resort to in order to display that power. Unfortunately, this sort of behaviour has become normalized and is now classified as the “rebellious stage”. The “tough guy” image is something that most boys tend to strive towards. Fathers tend to encourage this goal because “boys will be boys”. This often used generalization renders the option of breaking free of the stereotype obsolete. Any person that fails to comply risks being considered abnormal. Therefore, the behaviour that little boys are praised for by their fathers when they were younger is the very reason that teenagers become considered as monsters that are up to no good. This quickly becomes a vicious cycle. 

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In conclusion, there is only one area of any child’s life that is a constant influence and that is the family unit, who play a big role in forming a person’s grown up perspective on life. Morals and values that a child is exposed to while growing up is mostly under the parents’ control. Therefore, during childhood it is the parental figures that decide which values and norms should be adopted by the child. Throughout these years children are introduced to the societal template and brainwashed into conforming to these norms for fear of rejection from “normal” society.  TV and fairytales start the initiation of the child into society by establishing rigid gender roles and values which are considered the norm and must be followed. Then, there is an integration process during which the child is exposed to other children while being further guided through life by teachers as well as parents. During the school period those learned values and beliefs are reinforced through peer interactions. This is accomplished by making anyone that does not fit the “normal” profile into an outsider. Finally, those same teachers and parents demonize teenagers for being confused and not knowing how to live life properly. All these restrictions placed on children by parents and the society have created a glass ceiling that a lot of children will not be able to rise above because they were never taught how. <font color="#FF0000"> <strong><em><div align="center">Just be yourself?</div></em></strong></font>
