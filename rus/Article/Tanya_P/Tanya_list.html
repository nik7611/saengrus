<td>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><font color="#FF0000"><em>Just be yourself.</em></font></strong> This phrase is often used by parents as a philosophy of growth, teaching children to strive to grow up to be an individual. Unfortunately, this phrase is overused and has lost all meaning because children today are expected to grow up according to a society-created template. The notion of childhood is slowly disappearing as society is enforcing more and more regulations on how children are supposed to be raised. These restrictions are ideological, therefore, they are understood and enforced by millions of parents and guardians. From early childhood, mothers encourage their daughters not to play in mud because ìnice girls donít play with mud and get dirtyî. Likewise, fathers do not tolerate their sons playing with dolls for the fear of helping to encourage homosexuality. During bedtime little boys and girls are read stories which promote such stereotypical gender roles with the purpose of establishing the ideological division of the sexes.

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as humanity has existed people always seem to be drawn to power struggles. The people that have the power over others are in control of the dominant fantasy which makes that position much more desirable. If power is sought after so much, why are some people called ìnatural leadersî while others are dubbed simply ìfollowersî? Why are certain people trusted more than others? What makes society choose one leader over another? These questions are not easily answered. Through various techniques the ìgreatî people in history have conquered the minds of others. Every leader has had some sort of a strategy that they used in order to get to the top. This trend is visible in every day life, in the workplace, at school, or on the streets.
