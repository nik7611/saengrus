	<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as humanity has existed people always seem to be drawn to power struggles. The people that have the power over others are in control of the dominant fantasy which makes that position much more desirable. If power is sought after so much, why are some people called “natural leaders” while others are dubbed simply “followers”? Why are certain people trusted more than others? What makes society choose one leader over another? These questions are not easily answered. Through various techniques the “great” people in history have conquered the minds of others. Every leader has had some sort of a strategy that they used in order to get to the top. This trend is visible in every day life, in the workplace, at school, or on the streets.

A simple, yet powerful, example can be seen in schools. Many kids strive to be the center of attention, the alpha of the group. On a playground this attention translates into power. It is achieved through mindless commands being made by the child with the best social skills while the others simply follow. 
This power is exercised through eliminating any member of the group that happens to question the given commands. A lot of important leaders in history have tried to put down on paper their stories of success. From those texts it is understood that the leader as well as the followers play a role in this. The leader needs to understand the followers and figure out what they are looking for in order to try to accommodate those needs and win votes. Submissive people are what give those leaders the power. Therefore, in order to gain power, one must gain support. How is this support gained?<br>
This is accomplished by the person in power understanding the language thoroughly and applying it correctly. Most of the times people overlook the importance of language is in today’s society. It is our means of communication to each other. Without language there would be no society as we know it today. The ability to speak and understand is one of the things that makes this world civilized opposed to the prehistoric days. The power of this simple task is underestimated because of overuse and abuse.  The most powerful tool on this earth is language which can be used in order to manipulate people through various techniques, including the use of imagery, in order to change the world as we know it. This manipulation is demonstrated in “Mein Kamf” and “Alice in Wonderland”, whereby in the former Hitler is the leader who does the manipulating and in the latter Alice represents the masses who is manipulated by everything around her.

One of the reasons that language is very important to humanity is because it can be used to lead as well as mislead people into any desired direction. By choosing specific words and phrases carefully, the audience can easily be persuaded to agree with the speaker.  Hitler mastered the art of language which is what helped to get him to a level of power over the masses. Hitler’s strategies allowed him to mislead the masses into believing that his cause was just. He viewed the public as very stupid and therefore oversimplified his main messages into just a few words. This allowed for those messages to be easily imprinted into any conformable person’s brain. Any idea or statement that does not make a strong impression is quickly and easily forgotten by the masses, which is why those simple messages seemed more effective than scientifically proven statements. The media today has adopted that technique for advertising. Society today is very busy and does not have the patience for longer explanations. Commercials, for example, state their arguments very concisely in order to keep the public’s attention. The second phase of Hitler’s strategy is repetition. Once those simplified messages are out there, they need to be repeated over and over again in order to get the main point to make an impact. Ever since grade school teachers tell children that repetition is key when studying for tests because it helps to remember. Well, Hitler took that advice and used it. People were bombarded with his campaigns day and night. Coupled together with repetition is neglecting the opponent. Hitler’s technique was to emphasize the facts that he deemed as truth and completely neglect everything else. By doing this he made his opponents seem unimportant and not worth even paying attention to. The neglect of the opposing arguments allowed for a greater focus on Hitler’s beliefs.

 Alice, on the other hand, represents the masses. She was exposed to all kinds of influence while in Wonderland. She was surrounded by new and unknown things that to her made absolutely no sense. Alice was forced to question the actual meaning of language. Very often, she would be faced with a riddle and would easily get confused by certain words that were used. In Wonderland there is no such thing as play on words as we know it today. This is where Alice gets really baffled because in the language that she was taught there are thousands of phrases which are used as figures of speech. However, in Wonderland literal meanings of words were a part of their dominant fantasy. This is evident when Alice tries to explain some of the puns that she used to the creatures in this secondary world and they just do not seem to be capable of understanding it. Certain sayings that humans have adopted over the years such as fruit fly and horsefly came to life in front of Alice’s eyes. This book challenges our knowledge of language. It shows that as adults people forget how fun the language can be and just focus on the functional side of it, while children are still exploring and learning it. Therefore, as children it is easier to grasp the meaning of words in Wonderland.

 Another very powerful technique that was used by Hitler is the use of imagery. He used a lot of imagery for his campaign. Through pictures as well as words Hitler spread his message throughout the world. The posters used to spread Hitler’s propaganda were made to be very simple, again because of his belief about the public’s intelligence. These images focused only on making Hitler’s words seem as absolute truth and fact and ignoring and putting down of his opponents. In those images were pictures that would degrade the races that he hated and would raise up the German people. War videos were released in order to glamorize the war and to get men to enlist. These images were also shown in school to ensure that from a young age children do not know any different. This is the strongest tactic of all. If a child is raised believing something is true, that belief cannot easily be changed. Hitler’s hate propaganda was shown to millions and millions of people ranging from very young, to adult.

In Wonderland Alice was faced with imagery as well. A lot of this imagery came from the poems and songs that creatures shared with Alice on her journey through Wonderland. The imagery created was very bizarre mainly because of the literal meanings of words and phrases that were honoured by that world. Because of this influence Alice began to question some things about herself as well. This kind of mind control is very strong and cannot easily be overcome by anyone. Because of Alice’s rapid change in size, for example, she was called several different names besides human. Eventually Alice began to wonder whether it was true. She began to question her own identity simply because of some things that were said to her. It just shows how susceptible to manipulation the human brain is.

So far the effects of proper language use seem to be pretty unavoidable. What is the only way to truly resist its power? Education is the answer. An educated mind is not persuaded so easily. Hitler caught on to that and also applied it to his campaign. He stated in “Mein Kamf” that in order to be effective propaganda must be addressed to the masses and not the intelligencia. An educated person will be able to disprove those facts passed on as truth and to see right through Hitler’s plans. However, because today the world is ruled by a mass-society those few educated voices were easy to silence. To gain the masses’ attention Hitler made sure that his propaganda targeted emotions and not the mind. This allowed for a quick and heated response to the topic. People’s emotions are easy targets and Hitler took advantage of that. An emotional attack triggers a quick response which is a very good way to achieve quick and harsh action.

Alice considered her education very important. As a child the teachers and parents seem to know everything there is to ever know. This is why all they have to say is taken very seriously. However, in Wonderland Alice’s school education was of very little use to her. Every test that she encountered while in this alternate fantasy required the kind of reasoning that she lacked. Alice
considered herself to be pretty smart until she encountered a few riddles that she was unable to solve. In the very beginning of the text a possible indication of her losing her language skills was when Alice fell down the rabbit hole. She was fumbling with words the whole way down and that marked the beginning of her very confusing journey. From this point on Alice’s knowledge of her primary world was contradicted and challenged by the world that existed in Wonderland. At first, everyone that Alice encountered appeared stupid to her because of the difference in the two worlds. However, later on, Alice caught on and realized the ways of this Wonderland. She begins to understand that views other than hers do exist and that they’re not necessarily wrong.

These two texts rely heavily on the use of language. Language made Hitler who he managed to become. His supreme language skills were the only way that he could have gained so much support for something that is so morally wrong. “Mein Kamf” shows people as very similar to sheep. It shows the masses from their ugly and conforming side. “Alice in Wonderland”, on the other hand, shows humanity from their imaginative side. This text is a children’s book that has become a classic that most people have read and are very familiar with. Even from these two texts alone it is easy to see language at work. The words of one text depict the world in a totally different light than the words of the other. Language is just like any other tool on Earth – it can be used to better the world and just as easily misused for evil purposes.
